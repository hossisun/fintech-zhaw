My name is Son from SoftBank. Thank you very much for joining today. Recently there are lot of things that I regret or learned. What I am regretting is that I was too conservative or I was too smart - think small or because there are things like paradigm shift going on but too much focused on the daily routines and just spent times on that, and for those days, I should have act more aggressively to address the evolution of technology and the paradigm shift of the industry.
However in front of us, we need to turnaround Sprint, that’s the big challenge and also we had in Japanese market, which is relatively small, we did have several challenges. And as entrepreneur, and as a part of the information revolutions, I was actually told about myself and the regret and learn from there that I have focused too much on the daily workings and didn’t really thought big.
SoftBank 2.0 was actually made to create SoftBank Group Corp, a more global and aggressive company to cope with any changes or dynamics of this industry and we had to be the leading player of such a change. And the first change that we have made was the acquisition of ARM. By divesting something that unwilling asset and made the money to acquire ARM. And that is to be ready for the paradigm shift with ARM or in the industry, and I’ve been thinking about this company for the past 10 years and I made a decision but that was not enough. That was just the beginning of SoftBank 2.0. That was my thought. And to pursue the big changes or big growth of the company, we also had to focus on the debt level.
Of course easy to say that we reduced our debt by half by selling half of our position of Alibaba, that can be easily reduce our net interest bearing debt. But I still believe in Alibaba’s future. It is still in the process of growth and it has a big future. Last week there was earnings release announcement by Alibaba, and as you can see from there, they are still making a big growth and in the middle of the growth, from the sense not divesting of our asset, but those because are still very much promising and making a growth so not selling those but still at the same time be ready for the change. What kind of things needs to be prepared, and the answer was SoftBank Vision Fund that I came up with. And when we create such a base, then it shouldn’t be small. We should think big. So that is why that we announced the creation of SoftBank Vision Fund with ¥10 trillion. That’s also in my presentation now that I would like to go to the presentation material.
Consolidated results. This content is rather boring but the numbers are growing. And I think we have to go at least as much. Net sales, adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and net income, they are all growing. And if could explain this a little in yen basis, it is down by 0.2% but the domestic business is growing in sales and profit.

Now overseas business, Sprint. On dollar terms, sales is growing, but on yen basis, because of the strong yen, the sales is declining slightly and that is just an excuse. But adjusted EBITDA is growing both on yen basis and dollar basis, 7% growth. Yellow part is Sprint. As I said at the outset, until now it was a drag on SoftBank consolidated profit. It was a drag. However going forward, Sprint will at least be profit growth engine of SoftBank Group. Sprint will be a growth engine. And I have been confident recently that that will be the case, and I will elaborate on this later.
EBIT is also growing, and the breakdown is as follows. Yahoo Japan last year consolidated ASKUL. So there is a one-off profit, but excluding this event, the Domestic Telco, Yahoo Japan, Sprint are all growing steadily. The growth - in terms of growth rate, in terms of profit contribution, Sprint will be the largest factor.
With the acquisition of ARM, SoftBank’s consolidated net debt EBITDA multiple has once exceeded 4x but in the near future within a few years this will be below 3.5x. And once we fall below 3.5x, this will be a healthy level. And we think this below 3.5x multiple will be possible.
Now we talk about the major segments starting with domestic business. Domestic Telco EBIT, plus 9% growth. It is boring but steadily steady growth. The cumulative number of subscribers is growing, and SoftBank - since the start of SoftBank Mobile, churn rate has been at the lowest level and we are making various efforts to acquire customers, subscribers.
SoftBank Hikari. This is the driver of customer acquisition and is now functioning fully and steadily. And as a result, the churn rate is improving significantly and free cash flow is also growing dramatically. The account - free cash flow on accounting basis can be expressed in various ways but what is important is free cash flow as the result of business, CapEx or tax, including those factors, free cash flow is the money that we have in the end and free cash flow is now finally at the harvest phase. ¥600 billion level free cash flow. So we think we are in a steady harvesting phase. Going forward, we will be able to generate cash in a stable fashion going forward. So the Domestic Telco is trending very stably.
Next is Sprint. For the past three years, Sprint has been a drag on our consolidated basis and was the biggest reason our debt increased. Originally Sprint and T-Mobile, we were going to acquire both, merge them and have a company that is equal to AT&T and Verizon to have a hit on competition. That was our basic strategy. But because of the rejection by the U.S. government, our basic strategy did not work out. But as a result, we had difficulty, but we made steady effort. And as a result, the net loss stopped and net addition - we were able to make a turnaround for net addition, so now we are seeing a steady increase in the number of subscribers.
The churn rate is now at the best level in Sprint history. And as a result, churn rate is down and subscribers is now net addition, so the sales decline did not stop but now the - and the sales was declining in accelerated pace but now we are finally hitting the bottom and making a turnaround.
It is easy to increase cost to increase sales. Increasing sales to increase the number of subscribers is easy, but what we’re doing is decreasing, reducing the cost and increase sales. This is not easy. It’s not easy to reduce cost and increase the number of users but we’re doing this at the same time. And as a result, Sprint’s EBITDA, the profit before depreciation, has now doubled since we acquired Sprint.
In a few more years, Sprint will be the most dramatic large scale turnaround in the U.S. history. They will be marked in the U.S. economic history that this will be a big most dramatic turnaround in a few years. As a result, Sprint’s free cash flow has made a turnaround. Until now it was hundreds of billions of yen of loss every year. This is only first half, but on the annual basis, it was hundreds of billions of yen loss, deficit. But now it is turning around to enter the positive territory. So cost is reduced. Fixed cost is reduced, CapEx is reduced significantly. CapEx is now reduced by hundreds of billions of yen but even then the network improvement among the U.S. companies is showing the biggest improvement. This is because we are utilizing the network designing technology that SoftBank has cultivated over the years and this is functioning well. So Sprint’s network is now steadily improving and showing the highest improvement rate.

Free cash flow is improving and network is improving, and that is why Sprint’s churn rate is showing the biggest improvement at the highest level ever, best level ever. So Sprint had been a drag until now, but finally, we are seeing a good prospect of a turnaround. So now we can turn again to offence, so we are finally at that stage.
Another domestic business, Yahoo Japan. Yahoo Japan - the U.S. Yahoo posted big loss and has to do restructuring and is at the point of selling, but Yahoo Japan is growing steadily. Ads is now shifting from PC to smartphones, and in the small screen, the search ad and display ad value was seem to be declining, but Yahoo Japan is overcoming this crisis. And in e-commerce, it is showing the biggest growth in Japan. Yahoo is growing the most in e-commerce in Japan.
The SoftBank 2.0, as the first step of the aggressive move, ARM acquisition has been announced. And after we actually completed transaction and see the management meet with management and also meet - had a visit - made a visit to the major clients together with CEO, Simon, here. There are major seven or eight clients that we have made a visit and we had a management-to-management discussion and they are telling me that the ARM is essential company and that they would like to make a contract for about 10 years, coming 10 years or so.
And actually ARM has already made a development roadmap for coming 10 years or so. There are so many companies around there in the world, but actually there are no such company who can foresee 10 years ahead and create a clear vision of the 10-year ahead of developments roadmap. With such a fast evolving industry, and actually they are creating energetic people in part of the industry and designing building a 10-year ahead of the roadmap for the designs in each client show that the strong interest on joint development, joint project and so on. So we are happy to hear those.
So I am so happy and even more confident in ARM acquisition and also latest technologies create new revenue streams in making a rapid growth there. So in the various types of products, ARM is in it. IoT about one trillion products will be - are ARM products going forward. Not only those small devices but also in those network and servers like big equipments such as base stations of telecommunication service and so on also mounted with intelligent antenna also are using ARM antennas and so on.
So server side of the infrastructure and also closed side, the ARM core is going to be providing more and more services and also supercomputer, Post-K Supercomputer. This is also the national project of Japan. And the Post-K has already adapted and also decided to redesign with ARM architecture. So that’s the original made that actually going to use so much ARM products, so that they would be able to come up with more reasonable and also power-efficient energy-efficient structure is going to be made. So not only for the small devices such as smartphone or IoT devices, but ARM is also being used and going to be used with such huge projects or the products.
And also security is going to be even more important going forward. And recently in IoT area, virus is becoming more issue and hacking incidents are happening here and there and that has been also covered in medias and newspapers. Going forward, security is going to be even more important and that has been reconfirmed.
So whenever you buy a new car, do you know those cars sold as of today - did you know that there are hundreds of ARM products in one car, did you know that? Several hundreds of ARM products in one car. And not only ARM but also various microcomputer chipsets are there in the car. Did you know that? So those cars that you’re driving as of today, right now or are you buying, so those chipsets - actually those chipsets are all built in the cells that those are not encrypted. There are no such security in those chip areas at all.

So far car was only operated inside of the car and making a communication between chipset and chipset inside of one car, so the communication was completed inside of one car. Therefore there was no such need for encryption. Automotive producers are not been experts of microcomputer. They are just buying microchips outside of the company and just putting into the car. So they are not the experts of semiconductor. So purely or in a certain way, they are bringing - buying those chips and building, mounting on their cars. There is no such encryption in the car production but we didn’t have to worry about that too much. But you know now, there are connected car available around and slowly being covered by many medias. What is connected car? What car is connected to the internet, so the communication inside of the car is not completed inside of the car but actually it goes out of the car.
So not the internal communication any more, but the car is making external communication so that the communicating with internet, connecting with internet, such era already has come. So once you connect it to the internet not only the beneficial information is connected but at the same time you may be connected to the viruses, so you have a possibility of being hacked. But although there are no such encryption made in the chipset and once the virus comes in, what happens? All of a sudden, the car around the world - all the cars around the world could kick off the virus inside of the car and it could stop all the cars or the breaks is going to be out of service all of the sudden on the highway or sometimes somewhere. Then highway system could be damaged for 30 years equivalence may loss lots of big - huge risk of losing a lot of lives and so. So those kind of things are coming very near, so we cannot already unnecessarily just putting buying those chipset and putting into the car any more. It is going to be the matter of national security. It is going to be the matter of human beings’ lives.
So car which was not encrypted should not be connected, that kind of law needs to be regulated, and also automobile producers should recall those cars which has not been encrypted. So once that information society comes in, meaning that you have more convenience but at the same time you need to pay for the risk, so that security is going to be the most important tool.
At the same time more reasonable energy-efficient but also safety and security encrypted chipset is going to be most needed and that is going to be very important. And for that, this time new products Cortex-M33, Cortex-M23 has enhanced their security level and at the same time very small size. So 80% reduction of the size or 95% smaller, so you can see that this is the tip of the pencil and it is going to be about of same size, but this is even smaller in M23, so smaller and more efficient in energy and high capability but at the same time highly secured.
Usually if you enhance the security, meaning you need to encrypt it. The encryption meaning you need to encrypt it through therefore the performance is going to be go down. There are lots of burden on that, but still at the same time we have improved the capabilities performance but at the same time we enhance the encryption securities. So ARM equals to safely and secured inside [indiscernible] actually.
If you are not using ARM, meaning that you’re going to be - you have to worry about the security, so that is going to be the kind of key word. So from standpoint I am so happy to be able to have this company with our group. In the number of shipments, it’s increasing even more dramatically and explosively so that the SoftBank 2.0 and this is the first step of SoftBank 2.0. Why SoftBank Group has sold Supercell shares, GungHo shares and also even the Alibaba shares, partly sold willingly and went to the investment in ARM is because we wanted to be very much prepared for the time of the paradigm shift. And that will be touched on later but before I go into that, why I didn’t wanted to sell or I’m willing to sell of shares of Alibaba, that’s something that for your confirmation that I would like to pick up some pages.

Last week announcement Alibaba earnings results was made. Market cap actually exceeded Toyota which is the biggest in Japan in terms of market cap. Total market cap level is already bigger than that Toyota 20-some-trillion-yen, and in the past one year total revenue has increased by 55%. Net income in the latest three months ¥200 billion. Only for three months ¥200 billion net income and the size have increased by 41%. And Alibaba has not been in the matured stage yet. Actually it is making a lots of investment such as AliCloud on finance, Alipay and so on. So there are lots and lots of investments are also happening in Alibaba and not yet been matured but already making ¥200 billion per month - three months and also making an increase of 41% in net income.
So actually I didn’t want to sell share of Alibaba but even though I needed to sell a part of it, but actually we still have about ¥7 trillion to ¥8 trillion equivalent of the Alibaba share with us but actually this time we have sold for ¥1 trillion yen equivalence and still I wanted to do this first step of SoftBank 2.0. And that is because I wanted to accelerate the growth strategy of SoftBank Group to entering into SoftBank 2.0. Why are we heading there? It’s because there our vision that I’m so sure about and I’m so confident. You may not agree with me but for me this is something that I am so confident that we need to be serious about as a group which is singularity.
I’ve been picking this word so many times in the public occasions and speaking of singularity but intelligence capability of computer is explosively exceeding the intelligence of human being, and we are almost there. Actually in some segments there has already been happening such as chess or Go or so those kind of things has already shown improved that intelligence of computer exhibits human beings intelligence. So game of Go or chess is the limited area for now but actually that will be happening in variety of areas. So as the singularity time that the computer exceeds which means that the old industry needs to be redefined. So as like industrial revolution like agricultural or those manual productions, those kind of industry has completely changed by having the energies and that has been defined after the industrial revolution.
So in the past that those locomotive things has entered after having the energy and actually exceed the manpower and you can bring the - transport the things much faster and much longer, that’s the industrial revolution. But in information revolution not the manpower, actually you have energy so that human thinking is not any more. Actually microcomputer will give you even faster and deeper and precise answers than human things and also can improve the productivity.
So that kind of era is already coming so close, which means once again that all industry will be redefined like Uber type of service one example, good example I believe. Airbnb is another example. Fintech also already been refining - redefining the financial businesses. Telephone actually was the mainly used for the voice call but thanks for Steve Jobs that has been changed to smartphone, so redefined as a smartphone using the data over internet. And Steve Jobs actually said that re-innovate the phone and that was that the Apple reborn as the biggest market cap company. It was almost bankrupting before but actually that kind of change made a huge big change for the company and this kind of change will be happening here and there one after another.
And this is not only for the one thing, one industry or one business model, actually it’s the very much basic change and actually the size is going to be much bigger than what has happened in industrial revolution. And this can be regarded as the biggest project of human being. And SoftBank alone cannot be in time for those changes. Such a huge change is happening here and we alone cannot do that or cannot lead that, that’s why I actually regret those past days and decide to go into the new phase which is SoftBank 2.0, and as a part of 2.0 that we made acquisition of ARM. But still there was a challenge and you may have heard so many times and we actually scared so many times that SoftBank has huge debt, that was a big challenge.

So you have a good motivation but you have too many debt as well. That’s kind of concern that the market told us. So not increasing any debt but at the same time we need to address this revolution, that’s how I think about, and I was thinking about so hard and came to this conclusion, which is SoftBank Vision Fund.
So this first step of ARM acquisition of SoftBank 2.0, our debt, leverage ratio actually exceeded 4.0x. At the time of acquisition of Vodafone K.K. we went to above 6.5x or so and we reduced our leverage ratio. And with this Sprint acquisition and ARM acquisition, we have increased to 4.0x. So leverage ratio-wise that it became to 4.0x or above. If you add more debt, then we cannot really address SoftBank 2.0. So what we should do? Of course like I said earlier that we can - we are earning about ¥600 billion level of free cash flow from the telecom - as a network operator, but that will be not enough. That level of the money will not be enough for the time of SoftBank 2.0.
And here that we are trying to improve the balance sheet by reducing the leverage ratio from 4.0x from 3.5x, and at the same time being aggressive mode, which is the reason why that we came to this conclusion SoftBank Vision Fund, and size is about ¥10 trillion. AIIB [ph] that mainly led by China was about ¥1 trillion but actually 10 trillion is the aggregated amount of the venture capital in United States for the past two years, or the equivalent to 2.5 years equivalence of the - all the total aggregated amount financed by joint-venture capital in United States.
Investment fund of private equity, the biggest one financing amount - actually we are - ours 4.5x of those or the size is like that but at the same time I believe ¥10 trillion is something. And to me this is the first step, so I actually wanted to kind of remind you that this is the entrance of SoftBank 2.0. And with this ¥10 trillion, we would like to make it successful and then that we can think about the next step. But out of ¥10 trillion, ¥2.5 trillion is going to be coming from us, and as a partner - for the first partner who agreed with this idea was Saudi Arabia, PIF, Public Investment Fund money that agreed the idea and putting the money of ¥4.5 trillion. And other investments we are contacting to several potential investors and we have received a strong interest so that we are quite sure that we’d be able to raise about ¥10 trillion.
And our investment track record. So we’re cultivating our market one by one and that is giving us ¥600 billion lever of free cash flow after tax only from Japan. But at that the other hand for the return of the investments business, we have about 44%. So this 44% is the track record from the past 18 years. In the past 18 years, we have made investment into the internet companies and made returns, which is 44%. So we are actually doubling down return in every two years.
And here, because we made a big success in Alibaba, so that’s why we made a big achievement. That’s not true. Actually it’s not really coming only from Alibaba. Of course the size was Alibaba is huge, but if we exclude Alibaba what happened to our IRR? That kind of question is frequently asked, and we actually worked on that, and if we exclude Alibaba, our IRR was 43%. So even without the big success of Alibaba, IRR already being achieving 43%, not 44%. And this is because that we made a small company, so that we have a huge return. So what happened if we also include the telecom operators? What I said that there is heavy burden which is Sprint and also Vodafone K.K., if we add all those two and recalculate, then the investment amount was about $30 billion and the return was $190 billion. So we invest ¥3 trillion and we received as a return of ¥20 trillion. So this return was the - and we have surged for over 18 years, not like three years or two years something like that, but we have surged and steady once again that we have made this much of the returns so far.

So in the past 18 years, we have also compared with the major funds in the company, so we don’t specify the name here, but they are actually making about 15% to 10% level and that’s the IRR that they are making. So there are no such company that is achieving 44% of the IRR. So this was the result. So we were once again had a confidence in ourselves regarding investment activities as well. So in the SoftBank 2.0, we want to be so ready for the biggest opportunity in humankind which is similarity. And this is a partner that who actually responded to me first, a young leader in Saudi, and he said, yes, we will do it together. So we did a very good discussions and he agreed with my idea. This happened about last month and we signed a memorandum and he himself also had a strong interest to have SoftBank as his partner.
So here is the financial strategy. SoftBank is going to be improving our leverage from 4.0x down to 3.5x within a couple of years and further down going forward, so that any investments above tens of billions of yen will be in principal made through this fund. So it’s going to be non-recourse to SoftBank Group so that this could not be influencing to SoftBank Group so the major investment will not be made by adding more debt in SoftBank Group but actually inviting partners and raise money and also receiving some fees from partners and making a successful investments, so that we will sure to improve our balance sheet because we are generating ¥600 billion of free cash flow and also new investments with certain size is going to be made through this fund, so that naturally speaking that our leverage is going to be improved. So structurally our balance sheet is going to be improved from that sense.
So the biggest opportunity in humankind, which is singularity, and we want to be ready for that and we will become the leading players in the singularity with more security, so we would like to head towards the SoftBank 2.0. Thank you very much for your attention. That is all from me.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Now we would like to open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions]. We would like to take up to two questions per person so that we can take questions from as many people as possible.
Unidentified Analyst
This is TV Tokyo, Ohama [ph]. I have a question to you Mr. Son. You said - you may say that you’re not interested much but it’s about the Domestic Telecom business. Smartphone zero-yen sales, regulation on this zero-yen sales is being more stringent. Now if this is being more stringent, what do you think the impact will be on the domestic business, and if you are going to win in this competition, which will be the main competitive area in the Domestic Telco business?
Masayoshi Son
This is the MIC guideline rule. So there are various opinions whether this is good or bad, but it is a rule that is applied commonly to the industry. So the three or four players will be doing business under this regulation as a common rule, so this will be equal to all players. However there will be less replacements, so the situation will be more fixed, so less movement amongst subscribers. However this is a common rule, so we will all enjoy good days, we will all enjoy bad days. So whether this is good or bad, this is a common rule applied to all players. And so we will not see - anticipate any direct impact. No impact in terms of competition, but new profit growth. For new profit growth perspective, it is not just the Telco charge. The communication charge will have to be lowered so that many people can enjoy. So the unit price, the communication price - the unit price will have to be lowered. So what we will seek growth in will be new services, contents or comprehensive service, added service. Service has to be added. This is the portion we need for our growth.

Unidentified Analyst
So just for clarification, so the communication charges, the price will go lower - will be lower?
Masayoshi Son
Yes. The price per gigabyte, I think, will decline going forward.
Unidentified Analyst
My name is Owada [ph] from Nikkei Newspaper. I have two questions. First of all, it maybe not a boring matter which is domestic telecom operation. So ARPU is declining I believe. And once you did see the declines in ARPU, then those structure that you have presented today may be damaged. And in the mid-to-long-term period that SoftBank strength may decline.
Masayoshi Son
Yes, ARPU. As a basic policy, I see try to be more reasonable as possible reduce the burden as possible so that everybody can enjoy the telecommunication service. So we do need to cooperate to that. At the same time, the unit price is reducing but we do have a bundle service such as bundle with Hikari fiber, optical fiber-to-the-home or we provide unlimited service for music, movie, sport content so on. So we are also bundling those content comprehensively or we recently announced the joint-venture together with Mizuho on FinTech service, so financial service, content. So those comprehensive service needs to be considered by adding those variety, so that revenue per user in total can still potentially grow.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. Another question. So ¥10 trillion funds, so in investment. We have a big agenda before mentioned revolution, but in which area - which segment are you going to be focusing on investing?
Masayoshi Son
In principal, singularity is the recent big word, but once I encounter with support of chipset that I’ve been thinking the biggest revolution paradigm shift with microcomputer is happening and that’s why been - I’ve been running this company and that will be even more accelerated in speed-wise. In the area for those can be anywhere. Any industry can be redefined or re-innovated and there will be so much business opportunity out there so that it’s - we should not limit to the one segment or sub-segment but within this big agenda - Uber for example is was not in the scope and I regret that we should have invested. We did have opportunity to invest in Uber in earlier stage and I had a chance to meet Travis in the very early days and we didn’t made a decision to make an investment in such company and I learned a lesson from there and thereon that we have decided to invest in those right sharing service company in China or other areas, which was actually not in the scope in traditional angle but with this singularity and with this information revolution, any industry will be redefined and any things can be in potential. So Uber type of service or Uber type of segments is now in the scope of our fund investments, so that we would like to be wide open for any opportunities.
Unidentified Analyst
Mukaya [ph] from TV Asahi. I have question on your power business. KEPCO’s decommission cost is now increasing so to generate the cost - source of cost for decommission, the increase of the charge and the price of the - profit of this transmission subsidiary is going to be used. So what is your plan or thinking behind?
Masayoshi Son
I think KEPCO’s thinking is wrong, fundamentally wrong. They are doing this to protect the old industry. So the negative legacy is being pushed on the new area, so the new area that should grow it is now taking the strength of the new business that is supposed to grow. So as this discussion progresses, this discussion has to be well balanced by listening to many peoples’ views.
Unidentified Analyst
I have one more question. Before the Japan-Russia talks from to Sakhalin to Hokkaido of the shift is being discussed. Asia Super Grid is being considered by you. Once this government talks progress, will you go into the transmission line, power transmission business?

Masayoshi Son
Yes, I have a plan.
Unidentified Analyst
Any concrete plans right now?
Masayoshi Son
First, the technology feasibility study will take place. We have started to study this partially, and if we think this will be cost viable and if it is technologically viable, then yes we will move ahead, but it has to meet - make ends meet.
Unidentified Analyst
My name is [indiscernible]. Coming back to another boring question. So guidelines is issued from MIC and I see the declines of shipments of mobile handsets. Do you have any countermeasure for those, or are you going to address that, and also they are slowing down of the movements in the mobile phone market. Didn’t that damage your big picture or structure that you are trying to prepare here but do you plan to address those?
Masayoshi Son
I want you to understand the business model here. We are not making any - almost any money by selling handset. Actually it is making rent [ph]. So declining of the customer numbers then that will make a big damage to our revenue structure. So not decreasing the number of users, subscriber numbers, but just reducing the number of handset sales does not give us any big damage to our management results. So by reducing the shipments of handsets, we will give the biggest impact to those companies that producing hardware of those mobile phones. Those companies may receive the big impact. So the Japanese smartphone vendors actually in crisis I believe. So that there are pros and cons. So only the change of the shipments of firms, it would be the big damage to those handsets vendors in Japan. So we has not decreased our customer base and the competitors were competing over those customer base. But coming back to your question, the telecom operators revenue and also the market is pretty much matured, how can we grow from here, then I will repeat myself that the comprehensive service including more content, new service like a FinTech or finance.
Also collaborating with Yahoo Japan, that we will be able to make more additional services as the comprehensive service and that’s going to be good revenue contributor to us, so separate from the telecom revenue, we being seeing the potentials of the revenues source.
Unidentified Analyst
So related to that, I have second question. iPhone sales, iPhone 7 sales, how are you doing so far? And Apple Pay has launched the service, do you see any another service to start with from the Apple Pay?
Masayoshi Son
iPhone sales is doing good. For Apple Pay, iPhone is going to be used for the variety of payment structure, which will give us some additional advantage of benefit, but we don’t receive any allocations or revenues directly from Apple from that service.
Daisaku Masuno
This is Masuno from Nomura Securities. I have two questions. One is on fund. First ARM. So management has a view up to 2020. So without doing anything, ARM people will - from access to mobile to [indiscernible] shares, server side maybe a challenge but IoT however - device so now TrustZone is there. And so you have the device, but on the cloud side and with cloud was announced just recently, so it is just starting. So in timeline in the next five years, what kind of launch are you anticipating? Could you share with us your view?
Masayoshi Son
So in five years, ARM internal target is currently, in server, 1% market share, and up to hopefully 20%, and in server, Intel has 99% market share, so they are monopolizing market and we want to take up the challenge to enter this market. In IoT, at least microprocessor is connected to the internet. In this area, we already have close to 80% market share. In the IoT era, ARM will have to climb this difficult - it’s not where we have to climb a difficult mountain. This is the microcomputer that is connected to the internet. 8-bit and 16-bit are basically not the chip to be connected to the internet functionally speaking. 32-bit, in 32-bit ARM has close to 80% market share, and so in that sense - in terms of chipset can connect to the internet ARM already has 80% market share. So we can - by providing products to meet the demand, ARM can take the leadership in the IoT era.

In cloud, as I said earlier, mainly in servers, ARM is still weak. And so we will have to move one step at a time to go through this long road.

Understood. Now my first question fund. So ¥2.5 trillion and five year cumulative. You mentioned that the leverage ratio will be down to 3.5x, which means ¥500 billion a year investment. There will be a cash out. So after achieving 3.5x, you will accelerate your investment in the fund? Is my understanding correct? And based on what you said, more than ¥100 billion will be through the fund, so you will not do the investment through your company, so like ARM and Sprint, the investment as subsidiary will no longer be done going forward?

The subsidiaries will - the ones where they will acquire 100% will be done by subsidiaries. Subsidiaries will use their own cash flow to do a wholly-owned acquisition but those will be smaller amount, smaller scale. Small scale will continue. But for large scale, we will basically use the newly established fund. Then there may be a conflict of interest. There may be a view that the SoftBank will only cherry pick and sold. We will have the threshold amount, that is why we are adjusting the amount to set the threshold, and beyond that threshold we will use the fund.
Now we will - in order to improve the ratio, we are preparing the other tool, with which we can improve the improvement. I cannot make any concrete comments at this point in time.

So that means that fund can operate the business, investment business, but like ARM or Sprint, I believe needs to have exit but what happened to those companies? Funds will have a policy to exit in some tens of years. So it’s not exiting in three or five years, but average 13.5 years that we’re holding of such investments once we made. Some people may think that the matter once invest he never exit, so that’s the kind of a common understanding in the market but actually we’ll be making some divesting as well.
In average, we’re holding about 13.5 years. So in such level, we may partially - or in some companies we may exit whole shares but we will be using partners’ money together with our money so that we do need to make sure to achieve this certain level of IRR and that would be our obligations. And the next question please?

My name is Osa [ph] from Mynavi News. So your role became unclear after your presentation. So far I actually understand that you’ve been always hands on and making a turnaround of the telecom business. But with this fund business of fund established and hearing you that the sounds like your turnaround of the business has already been accomplished but what happened to your role then?
Masayoshi Son
For example, Alibaba, out of our enterprise value of SoftBank Group, Alibaba is the biggest, which I don’t touch on daily basis. I’m as an external director of the board. And I’ve been making some comments on the important strategy and also we are meeting with Jack Ma at least once a month in person. But basically the daily operation is done by Jack and Daniel, who is the CEO, and they are doing their own operations with their own decisions.
Yahoo Japan is also the same. I’ll make some comments at the time of the importance, but those are the separate independent-listed company.
SoftBank Mobile as well. As of today, Ken Miyauchi is leading the company, and together with him there is a management of the company. So I don’t participate in the normal management meeting of SoftBank Mobile.
Sprint as well. I’ve been very much involved as the Chief Network Officer in designing network, building network, and I was leading the project, but then sometimes in year or two that that’s going to be completing. So that’s going to be also finishing my role as well. So me, I will be doing some decision-making on the investment portfolio and also create the environments to be able to generate the synergies amongst the company. So you are not the player of the orchestra, but actually you orchestrate those portfolios so that we are able to direct the direction of all the companies or subsidiaries who should be playing the piano, who should be playing the violin and where they should be playing. That kind of orchestration is going to be my main role going forward.

And fortunately, ARM is a very successful company and also has been a very successful listed company so far, so that in very beginning we are having a lot of frequent communication almost every week, also having once a month in-person meeting with the management to discuss the business but actually they are very much successful company already and very much number one market share company. So they don’t need any turnaround or anything like that.
They are making already a good time. So the case that the company requires turnaround I should be heavily involved but it’s not the case, then I relatively light on the involvements, so that I can cover many more because of that.

I’m Kamiguri from Asahi Newspaper. Thank you. You talked about the investment return compared to the other well-known fund. You are having 44% IRR, much better than the others. Now, Son, you have achieved this high returns. Why do you think you achieve this high return? Is it your intuition or your idea, your foresight, what is it? Now second question. Where would you be basing yourself or focusing on SoftBank, rather than the company management, or are you going to focus more on the investment funds, the decision in the coordination, will that be more of your focus going forward?

Human beings have left brain and right brain. Left brain is more the theoretical area when you accumulate theory and work, and the right brain is more intuition or creation, creativeness, in charge of creativity. So artists are using the right brain. And Mr. Habu, the Japanese chess shogi, I think he is the master of the right brain. Until now, I was mainly using the left brain to use theory, SoftBank Mobile, Sprint. I was doing theoretical work until now.
On the other hand for the past 18 years, I’ve been using my right brain like a hobby to decide some deals, investment deals. So I have been using both brains, but in terms of the breakdown in time, left brain accounted for most of my time. I said boring which I maybe shouldn’t have said so, but I was working on the steady day-to-day business. 90% of my time was on that and until now the right brain, the investment side was only 10% of my time or maybe 3% of my time in the past, so that was the breakdown. From now on, right brain, the investment decision management will be a bigger focus in the day-to-day cash flow generating business, the steady business will be done by the great CEOs in - the experts in each business, so they will be doing the operation.
As an image, Warren Buffett in the technology industry, that is what I would like to become. Berkshire Hathaway in the technology industry. They have the cash flow as an insurance on one side, and on the right side, they are doing investment and they have both, they combined both well in their business model, that’s Berkshire Hathaway. I want to become Berkshire Hathaway in the technology industry. I would like you to see SoftBank like that. Any other questions?
