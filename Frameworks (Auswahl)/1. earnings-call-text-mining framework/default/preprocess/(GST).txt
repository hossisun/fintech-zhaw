In the first quarter, our average daily production was 13,200 barrels of oil equivalent, or boe, up 5% from production in the first quarter of 2015 and down 5% from the fourth quarter of 2015.

Total Company first quarter production was 56% liquids, but our Mid-Continent production was 71% liquids or more specifically 50% crude oil, 29% natural gas and 21% natural gas liquids. Thus with the sale of our Appalachian Basin assets now complete our production profile will be more weighted to oil and natural gas liquids going forward.

Net production from the Mid-Continent area increased an average of 6,100 boe per day in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 5,900 boe per day in the first quarter of 2015 and declined slightly from 6,200 boe per day in the first quarter of 2015. First quarter production came in at the low end of our guidance due to weather in Oklahoma that caused power outages which in turn effected our electro submersible pump or ESPs. Many of our wells are lifted using ESPs that are not operable when we lose electricity which happened several times this quarter as a result of sphere weather in the Oklahoma City area.

Because these wells produced both oil and water the water tends to build up quickly when the ESPs go down, it then takes a few days to a few weeks to pump that water down and restore oil and gas production back to its previous levels. We've also been replacing some of the EPSs with commission [ph] pump mechanisms to minimize these effects. Production during the first quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 600 boe per day for the quarter due to weather pump repairs and a brief third party pipeline repair on the system servicing our [indiscernible] acreage.

During the first quarter we drilled the Holiday Road 2-1H well, our second operated well testing the Meramec formation. It began flow back on April 11 and is producing high volumes of completion fluids with oil productions slowly ramping up. Although it is early we are encouraged by the high volume of completion fluids been recovered and initial crude oil and natural gas production. The continuing movement of our 3,000 barrels per day for the total fluids is typically an indication of strong reservoir characteristics. We expect the well to reach peak production rates 60 to 90 days after initial flow back operations begin.

The well was drilled with the lateral length of 4,300 feet compared to our initial Meramec test of the Deep River which added a 5,100 foot lateral. Despite the shorter lateral length we completed both wells with 34 frac stages and approximately £12 million of profit. Obviously we’ll be closing monitoring the impact of this more concentrated completion design on the well performance. We do expect to see a continuation of the trend of better well performance been positively correlated with completion intensity.

Despite the large number of completion stages the Holiday Road well was drilled and completed for approximately $4.5 million substantially below our original budget of $5.5 million and the actual cost of the Deep River well at $6.5 million. Contributing to the cost savings were faster drilling times, a lower day rate for the rig and other ancillary services along with lower cost per stage for the completion of work.

Included in our cost is approximately $520,000 to fish out coil tubing that became stuck while drilling out frac plugs. We do not expect to incur those cost on ongoing basis in future wells. Using a 4 million drilling complete cost assumption in our 705,000 boe Meramec type curve, this well would be projected to generate a 61% internal rate of return at current strip prices.

Our Deep River Meramec well continues to perform in line with our tight curve and as expected. As we've mentioned on previous call third party operated activity has continued to de-risk the stack play around our acreage with their wells demonstrating solid economics. It is important to understand that the surrounding operators are de-risking not only the Meramec formation, but also the Osage, Oswego and Woodford formations. Very prolific wells in each of those formations have been drilled near or within our acreage footprint in Kingfisher and Canadian counties.

These activities are conformation of the multiple pay zones that exists on our acreage and the strong returns that can be generated through exploring each perspective formation. We've decided to with draw our efforts to market a portion of our Mid-Continent assets, mainly approximately 26,000 net undeveloped acres located primarily in Canadian County. Our launch to this marketing effort was concurrent with several competing packages most of which were larger and substantially more developed in our asset.

While there was interest in our acreage many of the potential buyers wanted to evaluate the more developed packages on the market. As our asset is fill in its early stages further consolidation of acreage combined with future operated and non-operated drilling activity within and near this acreage should quickly de-risk our position resulting in a more attractive asset to potential buyers in the future. We will reevaluate the potential divestures as this packages clear the market and offsite activity continues to de-risk our assets.

I'll now turn over to Mike for an update on financials and I'll return with a few further remarks.

Mike Gerlich

Thanks Russ, and good morning everyone. As usual, I will detail some of the highlights from yesterday’s news release and provide some additional explanation on a few items and review guidance. For data by-area of operations, please refer to the press release and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed yesterday.

Starting with the top line. First quarter 2016 revenues from the sale of oil, condensate natural liquids and natural gas, excluding the effect of hedging, were $14.5 million. This is down 40% from first quarter of 2015 due to a 43% decrease in weighted average realized price per barrel of oil equivalent, slightly offset by a 6% increase in total production. As a percentage of total production, crude oil and NGLs were 27% and 29% respectively bringing our total liquids production for the first quarter to 56%.

These production percentages include Marcellus and Utica production, properties which we completed the sale of on April 8. Revenues from liquids as a percentage of total revenues, excluding hedging, were 72%. Before the impact of hedging per boe pricing was $12.07 for the first quarter compared to $21.28 for the same period in 2015 and 13.82 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Commodity derivative contracts that were settled during the first quarter increased our average realized price for equivalent by $5.64 or 47% from $12.07 to $17.71 per boe, this compared to prior years first quarter, when hedging impact increased prices by 25% from 21.28 to 26.54 and to the fourth quarter 2015, when hedging increase prices by $6.02 or 44% from $13.82 to 19.84 per boe.

In the first quarter 2016 we monetize all of our hedge positions covering April 30, 2016 through July 31, 2016, for net proceeds of 3.1 million, there by accelerating the second quarter hedge benefits into the first quarter. The majority of proceeds derived was from monetizing oil foot spreads in three way, they were at their maximum in the money value as the front month oil price was $37.14 at the time of monetization.

Early monetization assured us maximum hedge value, should product prices improve, which has been the case regarding oil prices. On April 29 when the oil prices -- oil price of future [ph] improved to $45.92 we added a 1,500 barrels per day costless collar at 40/53. To assure U.S. price protection on oil for the period April to July 2016. We also liquidated natural gas in North East out of the money basis hedges in contemplation of West Virginia property sale that closed early April. We continue to maintain an active hedging program covering estimated of future production, you can find complete details of our current hedge position posted on our website.

Our expenses were generally in line with our guidance except that taxes came in on the low end and these operating expenses were on the high end. As Russ mentioned, we had an unusually high amount of down time associated weather, ESPs and work over activity which drove higher LOE pre-barrels produced in the first quarter. Moving to the bottom line, adjusted net loss for the quarter was 17.07 million or a loss of 0.22 per share, excluding the impact of a 48.5 million noncash pretax seal and testing [ph] imperilment charge, a 6.5 million loss resulting from the mark to market of outstanding hedge positions, 275,000 of non-recurring cost relates our Mid-Continent acquisition and 537,000 of severance cost related to Appalachian property divestments. This compares to adjusted net loss of 7.3 million or 0.09 per share in a prior year and to an adjusted net loss of 12.6 million or a loss of 0.016 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015.

First quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA was 10.7 million a decrease of 47% compared to 20 million a year ago, quarterly adjusted cash flow from operations was 164,000 or $0.00 per share versus 9 million or 0.12 per share a year ago. The detail for these non GAAP financial matters were included in yesterdays new release.

Now I’ll turn to guidance, second quarter 2016 production is expected to be between 6,000 and 6,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with total liquids as a percentage of production in the range of 68% to 72%. A mid-point increase from first quarter Mid-Continent actually reflects the return of WEHLU production to normal production levels and natural declined.

As I mentioned earlier we cashed out our second quarter hedges in the first quarter, so the only hedge impact we will have in the second quarter will be related to the costless power oil hedge we added in April. Detailed information on our second quarter guidance regarding cash expense is available in our press release. As a reminder effective March 9, 2016, our revolving credit facility prohibited the payment of cash dividends on our preferred stock commencing April 2016.

Accordingly we seized payments on dividends on our Series A and Series B preferred stock in April. Dividends on the Series A and Series B preferred stock will accumulate regardless of whether any such dividends are declared.

Regarding our liquidity, at March 31, 2016 we had approximately 27 million in available cash and cash equivalents and a 179.6 million in borrowings outstanding and 370,000 in letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility. Subsequent to quarter end on April 08, we completed the sales of our Appalachian Basin assets for an adjusted sales price, of 76.6 million. In connection with the sales our borrowing base was reduced to 100 million as previously negotiated with our lenders and we paid down our debt by 80 million using primarily the sales proceeds to reduce our outstanding borrowing. We have approximately 20 million in cash available today and we have no availability remaining under our revolving credit facility.

In closing we have sufficient liquidity to make our upcoming interest payment and carry out our remaining limited planned 2016 capital program. We acknowledge that liquidity is type, but we have control our capital expenditures with capital spending in Q2 estimated to be only 3 million. Control over expenditures coupled with improving oil prices should allow us to navigate the tight liquidity while assessing all possible sources of additional liquidity.

Now I’ll turn it back to Russ for final comments.

Russ Porter

Thank you, Mike. Recent improvements in commodity prices will have an impact on gas as we move forward with approximately 50% of our current production volumes attributed to crude oil and 21% natural gas liquids were nicely leveraged increasing oil prices. Although it can generate better cash flow and more acceptable margins at recently improved prices we currently plan to maintain our limited capital plan for 2016. We also continue to evaluate all potential avenues from proving liquidity and reducing leverage.

Our stack play assets contain over 3,500 gross drilling locations and 5 proven formations with attractive economics in today's commodity price environment. There are several stacked properties being marketed that should help establish our valid comparative valuation for our assets. We do have valuable assets of [indiscernible] to manage through the worst of this cycle and with this strong under pinning value should allow us to manage through recovery, even a slow commodity price recovery.

That concludes our prepared remarks. At this time we are ready for questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

At this we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.

Mike Kelly

Russ a question for you, I think it's easy for us financial guys and they’re probably wrong to look at a rate on the Holiday Road well, 49 barrels a day, three weeks into production here and dismiss that as a pretty mediocre well at best. The question is, is there a president here in the area where you could be at such a rate three weeks in and 90 days from now you’re ultimately peaking at a 1,000 barrels a day and you really on a trajectory to knock out a 700,000 barrel EUR well. Thanks.

Russ Porter

We certainly saw some of our Hunting wells perform like that, what we saw was we had wells that would come on very rapidly, like the Deep River did once it started making oil and we've had wells that have had very slow gradual increases like this. Really doesn’t seem to be very well correlated with ultimately EURs, so we have every expectation that the Holiday Road well will improve and get to the point where it's substantially similar to our Deep River well. The thing about the Holiday Road well that is much different than Deep River is that it's moving a lot more volumes and a sign of some very good permeability. It's been as high as over 4,000 barrels of completion fluid a day which we never saw rates anywhere similar to that with Deep River well.

Mike Kelly

Okay, great. Appreciate that. And then the question on the acreage you had for sale and just curious on a number of things here, one just in terms of just the quality of that acreage like your thoughts there, may be compare it to what you have up North in the stack and just curious to why this really hasn’t been developed by the industry today. You mentioned the activities is really kind of coming down this way, anyway you could quantify that I think that would be helpful.

And then just finally the thoughts on this, if this -- if it does get proved up by industry, do you ultimately put this back on the market and how should we think about evaluation here, we saw [indiscernible] come out with and sell new field yesterday 10,000 an acre, is this potentially in that ballpark to get such as figure? Thanks.

Russ Porter

Okay hope I'll answer everything you asked here. As far as activity, during our sales process we did have some activity within the footprint of our holdings there one of the private operators in the area drilled the well that unfortunately had some mechanical issues and they completed it we think sub optimally and that well came on making oil and gas with a substantial amount of water. So that really hurt the process as we were into it and with some very poor timing for the drilling results to come out.

There is activity moving into this acreage and in fact that same private operator has pulled us where two or three well locations around that original well, we have the mud log, we had an interest in that well, we have the mud logs, we have all the drilling records, there were ample shows, the rock looks very good. In fact the rock in Canadian county and the Meramec has got much higher matrix porosity than we see anywhere in the Northern portion of the play, anywhere and near the Deep River or the Holiday Road wells. So from the rock standpoint it does with very good down there.

New field, some of the other operator are continuing to push the play in that direction sort of southeast from where some of their original operations were and then you've got activity coming at us from the south, you've got this -- I think they’re call it the merge or something like that, the area between this scoop for the southwest and the stack is getting more and more active and we’re seeing activity sort of approach us from the south also.

As far as marketing that property again we’ll have to just see what conditions and markets dictate if we’re able to address our liquidity sufficiently, we would love to keep those assets, further de-risk them with some drilling of our own and then possibly put them back on the market either as a standalone type effort or as a part of marketing our entire position at some point.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice. Please proceed with your question.

Ron Mills

Just may be a follow up on the Holiday Road well, I don’t know exactly what the peak level of fluids was at the Deep River produced but, if they were producing somewhere in the upper 2,000 to 3,000 barrels of fluid, at what point of the fluid production did you start seeing oil? I guess I’m trying to get the sense as to if at a similar level of fluids, were you yet seeing oil production of is this earlier than that comparable well?

Russ Porter

We’ve seen it a lot earlier than the other well, we didn’t see oil production on the Deep Road until we got down to about 2,000 barrels of completion fluid a day and we’re still up in the 2,800-2,900 barrels a day range, right now on the Holiday Road. Like I said we’ve seen oil sooner, it’s ramping up slower, but we definitely saw it sooner on the Holiday Road well and you got to remember with a shorter lateral, but with 34 states, 12 million pounds of profit, almost 13 million pounds of propane [ph] and the amount of slick water we used, 300 -- we used 372,000 barrels versus 340,000 barrels on the Deep River.

We physically just pushed that oil a long ways away from the well boar as part of the completion. We’ve very intensely completed this oil, we’ve obviously created a lot of permeability because of the flow rates, so now it’s -- we just need to be patients, get more that completion fluid produced back off of the reservoir and the oil and gas will come in. Had it not been for the fact that we would, this happens on a quarter, we wouldn’t have released these types of rate shift, because they’re just not indicative of what we think the well’s ultimately peak will be and what the ER should be judged on. So it’s very early to try to call that will, one way or the other.

Ron Mills

And then Mike on the liquidity side, in terms like the remaining CapEx that you have for the year, a lot of it is, it’s fairly discretionary in nature, is that correct?

Mike Gerlich

Wrong, yes this is Mike. Obviously at this point from the drilling and completion stand point the focus will be on, non-operated activity that we want to participate, so we can all the well information as we continue to de-risk our acreage position. Now the percentage that we elect to participate, we can dial it down if necessary, still get all the complete information on the logs, well production, et cetera on there. So that portion which is the majority of our drilling capital remaining budget is very scalable. And then on the land side we were a little heaver, in expenditures for the first quarter as the guys were getting the renewals done will we continue to have success on renewals, but we have slowed that down not getting quite as far in front of exportations as we have previously been doing.

Ron Mills

Great, and then also on the Canadian sales as it relates to the new field transaction yesterday, can you maybe compare and contrast some of the things in terms of your acreage down there is a little bit more blocky, all though activity is just moving towards it and on the adjusted peak [ph] packages at least in Kingfishers, it was a little bit more spread out, from a marketing stand point, so what are some of the benefits of the lay out of the package?

Mike Gerlich

I mean the biggest difference between the two packages is, ours is a fairly contiguous blocky position, that’s not as developed. There’s about 90% held by production, mostly because of old stripper wells so, I understand, how that makes it attractive. If those are not big working interest in it, the leases that they had, so it’s just the different animal. Ours is blocky, higher working interest, not as developed. Theirs was scattered but more developed and held by production. Most of their acreage was in Kingfisher and in the Blaine County, the geology on most of their acreage was very similar to the geology from the thickness and a depth perspective as the good portion of our Kingfisher position. So the rock is probably very similar, it’s just set up differently as far as the scale and the size.

Ron Mills

Okay then on the, on just the way the slack gets laid out between going from all the way through the -- from the Oswego, all the way down through the Hunton, especially as you move up North through your position, as -- how was the overall thickness of the Meramec change or does it change between formations, I’m thinking Osage versus the Meramec.

Russ Porter

It’s a pretty subtle geological picture there Ron, as you move north across our -- from south to north across our northern position, you go from about 250 to 300 feet of Meramec and a similar thickness of Osage to the Meramec thinning as you get that two-thirds of way across our acreage position, but at that point your Osage has thickened up to in excess of 500 feet. So, maybe we've confused people, maybe we've made this a little bit more complicated than it needs to be, we should just call everything stack and leave it at that, but as you Meramec thins, your Osage is thickening, your Osage is also sourced from the same Woodford.

North our position you've got very good Osage completions by Chaparral and growing activity north of our position in the Osage. So as we look across our acreage, every acre has got multiple formations that are going to be in perspective on it and if you’re just focusing on what people like the think of the stack right now, which is with Meramec-Osage series, we've got almost a 1,000 locations across those just those formations. So it's a very I think attractive position that we've been able to build up.

Operator

Our next question comes from Kim Pacanovsky with Imperial Trust. Please proceed with your question.

Kim Pacanovsky

Russ you said and detailed some of the non-Op de-risking activity that is taking place and will take place in your Canadian county acreage for south region and you also said operated activity. So can you tell us what you think a timeline is for, in the past to get to the point of putting a well on that acreage?

Russ Porter

It's as soon as we are able to address some additional liquidity, than we have a very tightly developed capital program to proceed with that is designed to de-risk each one of the formations across our acreage. One of the wells that we have in that eight or nine well plan is a well that will test with Meramec in the central portion of our Canadian County holdings. When you look at the activity that's moving from the northwest to that down towards us, towards the southeast and if you put that type well in the middle of our holdings along with the 100s of wells that we have from a long perspective we have data on, it's pretty easy to map this point out and what we’ve found is that even though you can have surrounded activity is very good that asset buyers put a lot more weight on operated wells that are within you're -- on your acreage or within your control.

So our plan is to -- as soon as it makes sense to go down there and drill an operated Meramec well, but we also have some extremely good upper and lower Hunton prospects or acreage to drill down there along with the fact that another private company [indiscernible] has just drilled some very good Osage wells immediately north of our Canadian County position. So they’re pushing the Osage further down then it's been shown to be productive in the past and into an area where you've got the Osage over some relatively thin Woodford and it's working very well.

So, like I said this was early in this play and there is a lot of confirmation that can be done I won't say validation because we already know the oils there and we know the rocks there and it’s just confirmation.

Kim Pacanovsky

And on looking at Payrock and they've drilled over 30 wells and they are I think they are all short lateral wells they’re all about lateral and New Field [ph] obviously is drilling longer laterals and I know you can't speak for either of them, but I know you also see data. So looking at their results what do you think is the right way to develop this asset?

Russ Porter

With a lot of money. What we're seeing is that we think the economics on the one-mile laterals are probably slightly superior to the longer laterals, and that's not in any way saying that when you look at New Fields done with their cost that's not in any way saying that they are not doing what makes sense for their position, but we would look at taking a finite amount of capital and spreading it out over as many wells as possible, drilling wells that cost $3.5 million to $4 million is a lot more logical for us than drilling wells that might cost $6 million to $8 million. So it's -- we think the economics are good, the results are good and it allow us to get more wells drilled.

Kim Pacanovsky

Okay, and then a question for Mike. Mike can you just comment on the cash G&A. It seems like the guidance is quite high compared to the previous quarter or the previous few quarters actually?

Mike Gerlich

Yes, it's up slightly obviously with production going down we really only have terminations and so forth in the West Virginia office, there will be a little more of that coming through in the second quarter such that they are completed early April. We are trying to get our G&A down as low as we can, when historically we’ve never been a company that has excess people or cost, so there is only so much we can kind of reduced on that end. But we’re going to work hard to make it trend down as we go more into the year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Will Derrick with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.

Will Derrick

And I guess first question on Holiday Road, what the D&C cost, on that well?

Russ Porter

We’ve got 4.5 million in it and as I mentioned $500,000 for that was related to some fishing cost, we have to fish some, coil tubing out of the wells, we were drilling out the plugs. So our recurring cost on that drilling complete is $4 million.

Will Derrick

Okay thanks and also for the year, in the initial budget, you all allocate some capital for lease maintenance across the whole position. I guess can you give us some more color on that, where you stand today, what’s your expectations are for the rest the year and what explorations could be they show in next?

Russ Porter

I’ll let Mike to give you details, so I think we spent around $8 million in the first quarter on land and leasing and Mike you want to pick it up from there.

Mike Gerlich

And then we -- looking at Ancohuma, we spend about $6.8 million. So that leaves us right now thinking from the drilling stand point we’ll spend another 6.6 again, the focus to that will be the scalable, non-operating well participations and then looking at about 12 million on land. So from that stand point, we’ll actually probably be down a little bit, we haven’t made formal reference that we kind keep in a budget there, but as I said it will probably lean to the low end and maybe we can drive it down further.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Steve Berman with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.

Steve Berman

Russ may have partially answered it at least, but I’m looking you Slide 10 in your recent presentation, with the 10 non-operated budgeted sack wells. How many those are actually in the books right now and I’m curious as to who you’re or what other operators you’re generate partnering up with, I mean it sounds like it would be a mix of Meramec and some of the other formations.

Russ Porter

Yes, I mean some of the operators are [indiscernible] New Field of course. We’ve got upcoming wells with SummerX Continental [ph] in addition to those guys, as far as I’m not sure what you meant by in the books --.

Steve Berman

More like have you already accepted AFEs on any of these I guess it how I’m [Multiple Speakers]?

Russ Porter

We have proved AFEs on them and I think on the eight so far.

Mike Gerlich

Yes correct. And then, sorry.

Russ Porter

And those are -- those also include Oswego, we got Osage, Meramec and Oswego non-Op wells that will be participating in the upcoming months.

Steve Berman

And then my other question is on, I know a lot of this is depended on how well the Holiday Road well does, but based on this current budget can you keep production flattish in the second half of the year in the Mid-Con, with what you’re spending here?

Russ Porter

[Multiple Speakers] Well we gave guidance for Q2 and with reflects that’s in our budget, we’re just not in a position to give guidance past the next quarter right now.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jason Wangler with Wunderlich. Please proceed with your question.

Jason Wangler

We’re just curious, Mike you kind hit on the think on Wills question about the leases, just as you look at the year going with that 12 million left, do you have an idea? Is that pretty spread out throughout the year and this kind a curious the terms of those extension or renewals, what you are seeing there in terms of, what kind of terms you guys are getting.

Mike Gerlich

I’ll speak to the timing expenditures, as I mentioned earlier land is kind of front end loaded, some of the renewals and extensions, that’s why our expenditures were a little heavier in the first quarter. As I’ve mentioned in my remarks, in the second quarter we’re looking to spend about $3 million, about 1.2 million of that’s drilling on these non-Op participations and reminder of that is really land renewals. Obviously then that will leave a pretty heavy weighting of that 12 million remaining in the third and fourth quarters. I can’t, I don’t know if we want to speak the terms that we’re renewing anything, Russ?

Russ Porter

No, I’d rather not.

Jason Wangler

Fine, I mean, I wasn’t looking for the pricing, rather I just -- is it possible to stand on the actual amount of time you get I guess, of is that something that you didn’t want necessarily to close.

Russ Porter

Close number of three years, and some were with three years with two year kickers.

Jason Wangler

Yes I wasn’t asking the certain the cost, obviously that’s still some in the works. Okay guys I appreciate, I’ll turn the back.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice. Please proceed with your question.

Ron Mills

My follow up is related to your position and I know last week New Field or maybe early this week updated their presentation and highlighted 24 wells in what they called their northern stack, which looked a lot closer to your position. How does -- any comments there for us and then secondly, in terms of thickness and what's your expectations are, how does your acreage compare to that area that turned in the solid results for them?

Russ Porter

New Field has drilled really up to our lease line, from the south maybe north and now have us pretty well surrounded on the entire southwest corner of our position with very good wells. They highlighted some wells that are just to the south of us. In that areas we see Meramec, we see 200 feet to 250 feet of Meramec and we see 300 feet to 350 feet of Osage there. So there is definitely multiple ventures. So we’re following what New Field’s done with multiple ventures and what spacing to us very closely and they’re haven’t a lot of success. I would say that our acreage there in the 188 to 189 range, in the 186 to 187 looks very, very similar to what New Field is drilling.

Ron Mills

Good. And then as you mentioned you had -- once you addressed the liquidity you have kind of a nine well program in mind. Does some of that activity located more in that portion of your acreage?

Russ Porter

Yes we do have couple of wells scheduled in that area to drill not immediate offsets to where New Field has drilled, but to drill three to four miles away from some of their better wells. But we've got acreage between their well and where we would drill ours. So yeah I'd think it will be fairly easy to confirm a big swap of our acreage through their, with one or two well results.
