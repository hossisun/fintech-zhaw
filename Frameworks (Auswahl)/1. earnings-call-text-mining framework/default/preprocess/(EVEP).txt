At the beginning of April, EVEP went through its spring credit facility redetermination process with our bank credit. Our borrowing base under our credit facility was reduced to $450 million, which was anticipated given the decline in forward commodity prices since our last redetermination in October of last year. To the benefit of EVEP, we were able to negotiate leverage in interest coverage covenants that provide a runway through the end of 2017.

In addition, the amendment provided for a basket of up to $35 million of balance sheet cash or available borrowing base capacity to repurchase our outstanding senior notes which are trading at a significant discount to par. As previously announced, we used $30.1 million of this cash to repurchased $72.9 million of our outstanding senior notes, which represents a price to par of 41.2%. This leaves us with under $5 million of cash with which to repurchase additional senior notes.

This authorized basket of cash for repurchases came with a few stipulations, one of which was that any distributions paid to unit holders for the remainder of 2016 would be subtracted from the basket on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Because of this, as well as our belief that it is important to preserve liquidity during these difficult times such as these, we have recently made the difficult decision to suspend our distribution. The Board and management felt the trade-off was fair when considering the amount of long-term value created for our unitholders after reducing our debt levels by $42.8 million and decreasing our annual interest payments by $4.8 million.

Including the senior notes repurchased in the fourth quarter of last year, we have been able to repurchase a total of $146.9 million of senior notes for $80 million, which generates a very attractive rate of return for unitholders. This reduces EVEP's total debt by $66.8 million, which is equivalent to $1.34 per unit and annual interest rate expense drop by $9 million.

As I have stated many times before, the distribution is important to me and our team. The stipulation from the bank group that the trade-off between buying bonds or making distributions this year was understandable and we made the best economic decision for EVEP. After 2016, our objective is to reinstate and grow our distribution in the future based upon a sufficient industry rebound, bank covenants and our financial results.

All-in-all earnings this quarter were in line with guidance. Production came in where we thought it would but we do expect some natural declines throughout the year, which was already incorporated into the annual guidance we provided in February. We are concentrating on continual cost reduction accomplishments in each division and are very proud of our employees' ongoing determination and ideas to drop LOA.

Due to the senior note repurchases as well as the decision to suspend distributions, the annual cash on our balance sheet allowed us to reduce debt and save on interest payments. Finally, I am happy to announce we expect based upon current strip prices to produce free cash flow after interest payments and capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016 and be in compliance with our bank covenants.

Now I will turn it over to Nick for an analysis of our financial results.

Nick Bobrowski

Thank you John. For the first quarter, adjusted EBITDAX was $20.2 million which is a 62% decrease from the first and fourth quarter of 2015. Distributable cash flow for the quarter was negative $1.2 million. The decreases in adjusted EBITDAX and distributable cash flow which are described in the press release under non-GAAP measures were primarily attributable to lower realized commodity prices, lower realized hedge gains and the sale of midstream assets in the second quarter of 2015. The decreases were partially offset by the addition of producing properties acquired on October 1, 2015.

Our partnership agreement requires that management and our Board determine the estimated average maintenance CapEx at least an annual basis. For 2016, that amount is $44 million or $11 million per quarter. We plan to actually spend significantly less than that amount this year and midpoint of our production guidance for the year implied that there will be a modest decline in production. Therefore, while distributable cash flow for the quarter was negative, actual cash flow that is adjusted EBITDAX less cash interest expense and actual CapEx was slightly positive.

For the first quarter, production was 12.8 BCF of natural gas, 317,000 barrels of crude oil and 602,000 barrels of NGLs or 201.4 MMcfe per day. This represents a 17% increase over the first quarter of 2015 and a 4% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase over the first quarter of 2015 was due to the addition of producing properties acquired on October 1, 2015. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2015 is primarily due to the reduction in drilling activity.

Our first quarter net loss was $29 million or negative $0.58 per basic and diluted weighted average limited partner unit outstanding. Several items to note that were included in the net loss are $10 million of non-cash gains on commodity and interest rate derivatives, a $3.2 million gain on the settlement of a contract associated with one of our Utica JV partners. Last quarter, if you remember, we recognized a $1.2 million loss with our other partner. So the net effect is a $2 million gain over the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter 2016. $1.6 million of non-cash compensation related costs contained in G&A expense, $700,000 of impairment charges primarily related to the write-down of certain oil and natural gas properties due to a change in the development plans for acreage in the Utica shale and $100,000 of dryhole and exploration expense.

We have layered in additional commodity hedges since our last earnings call. For 2016, we added 14 million a day in natural gas swaps for May through December and an incremental 3,000 barrels a day of crude swaps for May through September. For 2017, we added 30 million a day in natural gas swaps for the full year and 30 million a day in natural gas collars for the full year with a floor of $2.75 and ceiling of $3.27. This effectively hedges out all of our natural gas production for the remainder of 2016 and all of 2017 that is permitted under our credit facility. The details of all of our hedge positions are provided in the press release.

Finally we currently have over $170 million of liquidity between balance sheet cash and available borrowing base capacity. We believe that amount is sufficient to meet all of our near-term capital needs. As John mentioned, our borrowing base is $450 million. We currently have $285 million drawn.

Now I will turn it over to Mike Mercer for a review of our operations.

Mike Mercer

Thank you Nick and good morning everyone. Today I will discuss our capital expenditure program, our cost reduction efforts and the estimated tax effect for unitholders of our recent senior note repurchases. We spent $8 million in capital during the first quarter and the midpoint of our guidance for all of 2016 is $14 million.

As we mentioned last quarter, we anticipated our capital spend for 2016 to be front end loaded to the completion of nine wells in the Barnett shale, which have been previously drilled in 2015 as well as the fact that we have basically discontinued further drilling in the current price environment. All nine of those wells in the Barnett have been completed and have recently begun producing. I would remind everyone that we have an approximate 31% interest in the Barnett shale assets. So our net interest is equivalent to about 2.8 wells.

Results met our expectations coming in at just under budget at an average of 3.4 million per well would expect an initial production rates of approximately 3.5 million cubic feet per day per well. The spacing on these wells is 400 to 500 feet with horizontals of 5,000 to 5,500 feet. Now I would like to note that these wells and their production were accounted for in the guidance we provided in February.

On the cost side, our asset teams continue to work hard to find opportunities to reduce costs. Their focus has been on compressor optimization, chemical and salt water disposal savings, work over programs, labor cost reduction and the management of areas with marginal wells. We will continue to focus on these areas as the year progresses.

Before I jump into the tax discussion, please remember we are not tax professionals and you should consult your own tax advisor regarding your particular tax situation. What I would like to do is touch on the topic of cancellation of debt income or CODI where we received a number of recent questions based on our recent repurchase of senior notes at a discount to par.

CODI is basically the difference between the price we paid to repurchase debt at a discount and the price at which the debt was issued. Since we are a partnership and each of our unitholders are limited partners, this income will be included in a 2016 K-1s. The senior note repurchases already completed this year will generate approximately $0.86 per unit of taxable income to those unitholders who held units during the month of April when the repurchases occurred. I would like to note that that is $0.86 per unit of taxable income, not of tax liability.

However we would expect most unit holders, depending on when they purchased units to have some offset to this from ordinary losses from operations generated for this year. However, I would like to note that each unitholder does have a unique cost basis in depletion amount for the calculation of their specific ordinary income or loss each year.

I will now turn it back over to the operator to open the line for questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question comes from Kevin Smith from Raymond James.

Kevin Smith

Hi. Good morning gentlemen.

Mike Mercer

Good morning Kevin.

Kevin Smith

I appreciate all the overview. I don't have that many questions. But is there a time or maybe a price that you would consider asset sales again? Is there anything that you are looking for? Or is the main solution just going to be increasing in commodity prices and free cash flow to improve the balance sheet?

John Walker

Well, we don't need to do asset sales for sure right now. There could be some opportunities that come up where we might want to participate, particularly in situations where EVEP is partners with some of the institutional partnerships and they are selling. That would be something that we would value. We never have the obligation to sell when the institutional partnerships are selling. So we don't have anything on tap right now, Kevin, but we would look at it.

The situation, as you are very aware, is not a great environment in which to divest. In many ways, I believe that we are seeing a turnaround in particularly oil and NGL prices and obviously natural gas has its own unique characteristics, but I just don't think that this is the greatest time to be a seller. It's a much better time to be a buyer and we are as a lot of times people think that I will reduce EV Energy Partners and I would point out that EnerVest continues to be 5% to 7% of the asset market or the biggest factor we bought $2 billion of properties since September. So we are very aware of what's happening in the A&D market.

Kevin Smith

Thank you. That's helpful. I guess the only follow-up question then is, as we look at 2017's curve and where you guys are layering hedges at close to $3, does that change the logic there as far as selling assets or just expect to continue the course as it is now?

Mike Mercer

Kevin, as John mentioned, I don't think that we have any plans right now to sell any significant amount of assets in our portfolio. If prices move up and there were certain assets that just make sense from a strategic standpoint, we might consider it, but we don't really have any plans currently.

John Walker

Yes. I think one of the considerations, Kevin, is that several of the companies in our sector have to sell and we don't need to sell. And the issue here is in probably most instances people who are selling right now are selling below the borrowing base. And so that just creates a debt spiral for some folks. And we are fortunate that we are not in that position and don't have our backs against the wall.

Kevin Smith

Understandable. And then just lastly for me, do you think there is any further room to reduce operating costs or are they pretty much as low as you can go for at this point?

John Walker

It's interesting that we are the largest operating company in the United States. We operate 33,000 wells in 15 sites and we are adding to that. As a result of our concentrations in many areas, we know that we are the lowest cost operator in places like the Barnett, for example. But we have effectively created a competition among our divisions and every week the divisions are coming up with new ideas and they are sharing them with each other in terms of otherwise to reduce operating costs. And so it's a continual process.

As I think I said in my remarks, it's not that we just address the labor and we started ignoring things, we are doing everything that you can think of in terms of reducing operating costs and it's much harder to reduce LOE than it is drilling and completion cost because some of it's contractual. But we have been able to address and get lower cost on our compression, gathering and processing. And that's hard to do. But when you are a major factor in the market, you can do some things that smaller companies can't do.

Kevin Smith

Understandable.

Mike Mercer

The other thing, Kevin, is we have planned all this stuff out in our budget and we are still sticking with our guidance numbers.

Kevin Smith

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator

And our next question comes from Brian Brungardt from Stifel.

Brian Brungardt

Good morning guys and thank you for taking my questions here.

Mike Mercer

Sure.

Brian Brungardt

John, I appreciate the color on Kevin's earlier question with the commodity prices, but I would be interested in how that plays into the recent hedges that you have layered into subsequent to the quarter?

John Walker

Well, you will notice that our hedges primarily deal with natural gas and roughly 70% of EVEP is natural gas by volumes. And I am actually optimistic about gas if we can work down this. It's now 850 billion of overhang. It was one trillion of overhang from the warmest winter in our history. But that's the thing that makes me nervous this year and as I think all of you are aware the situation in Canada has impacted gas also. The price of gas right now is $0.91 in Canada and we have had an increase in the last few weeks of gas coming into the U.S. and it's really gas-on-gas competition. That makes me nervous.

I think that the price of gas right now is too high to work down the 850 billion cubic feet in storage. And so I am nervous about 2016 prices. I hope it stays at $2 or above. But we are well hedged for that and we believe that only upturn that we got in gas prices that we were able to lock in some very strong prices for 2017. So in the area that we feel most vulnerable as a company, we are well locked in. In the area where we are most optimistic, oil and natural gas, we have left some room for the upside that we expect beginning sometime later this year.

Brian Brungardt

Certainly appreciate all the color there. Then switching to the expenses. Just curious given the amount of cuts you have enacted to-date. How much do you anticipate you will be able to maintain as prices begin to recover in 2017 or whenever that time period may be?

John Walker

Well, the oil service companies are extremely good managers, better than that E&P managers in my opinion. And my experience in the past on upturns, the oil service companies get prices up very rapidly and therefore the prices that we are seeing, particularly in drilling and completions, are unsustainable. I do believe that we will be able to hold the line on LOE much better than B&C. My own opinion and having lived through several of these is while we spent all this time talking about our productivity increases in the heart of this reprise and it has occurred on the rebound we might get a 20% rebound, but after that we are going to see productivity declines.

And so I think that the market's missing that. We are going to reencounter 1986 in terms of recovery. There is probably going to be a loss generation of folks in this. My waiter this past Sunday for Mother's Day was a Ph. D. in geophysics. He will probably look for a job back in our industry, but there are a lot of people that have been out of work and this is the most extreme that we have ever had. 340,000 people worldwide and you don't hear a peep out of Washington about the 150,000 plus in the U.S. that have loss their jobs. So the recovery in drilling and completions is going to be difficult. We are going to have an experience curve with new people. There is going to have to be a lot of training. And so the rebound is going to much slower than people expect in my opinion.

Brian Brungardt

Interesting. And then just lastly going back to the transactions in October of last year, have you been pleased with those assets to-date? And do you anticipate any payments due as part of the VPP agreements given the lack of CapEx spending this year?

Nick Bobrowski

We have been pleased with the assets. We don't have any, the way the VPP works is that we are paying out based on production and so at the end of December, it will end and then we will not have to pay that amount out. So we will recognize an extra 5 million a day in natural gas production and the revenues associated with it.

Brian Brungardt

Got it. Thank you.

John Walker

It's not a VPP based on a dollar amount, it's just based on volume of production that ends at the end of 2016.

Brian Brungardt

I appreciate the clarity there. Thank you guys.

Operator

That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Walker, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.

John Walker

Well, thank you Cynthia. And thank you for all of you joining us on the call. I do feel like that that there is some sunlight breaking through our industry and I do feel like that particularly on the oil and NGLs side that we are going to have a rebound. I don't know when that's going to occur. My expectation is by the fourth quarter and that will probably psychologically, at least, help us on the natural gas side. So that's encouraging. The greatness here is, we are well prepared for the downturn from the standpoint of selling our gathering system and our processing and fractionation interest in Ohio. And that sure helped us be in a position to thrive when the rebound does occur.
