I’m also the largest stockholder and ever-growing Cenveo bondholder. I’d like to mention and I have set it several times during our calls, during this past year, I invested and additional $2.5 million in Cenveo stock and bonds to increase my total ownership of our company and I will continue to do that as we move into years going forward to include this year. And I just think it’s important that all of you know that all of our senior managers are buying our stock and I am too and we’ll continue to this process.

Today’s conference call will be our second call with our new and shorter format. We heard your feedback from the first call and we will continue with the new change with more time for Q&A. For example, today all of us will plan to spend less time on our updates and more time on the Q&A slot. As I stated last quarter, we heard you loud and clear and we need to have shorter reports that will develop more focused information for you our investors. And as a former salesman, I realized that the customer is always right and we will react accordingly.

Today, we will be talking about several positive events from a very good quarter, you saw the press release and we did have a good quarter. And there were some negative events that took place in our first quarter and we call them the weather. And we all read about it, we saw it on television, heard it on the radio, we drove in it to work, but I think it’s worthwhile mentioning that we put a plan in place with our managements and reacted accordingly and even with all of severe weather and the problems we had we were able to achieve and exceed our financial goals.

Even with the severe weather we face, this past quarter like I said we achieved and exceeded our first quarter goals because of good planning on the part of our pure management. The snow and bad weather was responsible for at least 25 of our plants messing a work ship. Now that may not sound like a lot, but it is. It means for 25 days and 25 of our plants people didn’t come to work that was nothing done, they couldn’t get to work or the materials couldn’t get to our plans or we couldn’t ship for our material.

Our most profitable location in New Albany Indiana missed two full days in the quarter and that is a lot when you talk about a quarter and you missed two full days. The Chicago envelope plant missed two days during the fifth largest snowstorm in Chicago’s history, I’ve lived in Chicago for 10 years and when they say largest that doesn’t means large and we lost two days out there and the storms and when you lose those kinds of days is very, very hard to recover.

Even some of our plants that have not been subject to winter or weather problems, lost multiple days and some states that they don’t even have snowplows in Georgia and Texas and Tennessee and I’ll tell you I have also lived in those states and it is very difficult to get around in bad weather. So this first quarter is good news for us and for us in the management team and how they reacted and I think that good news is welcome for a lot of reasons, many of you thought that 2014 was as a total disaster because of the NEC integration and I agreed that we could have communicated these problems much better but this master lease problem gave us little alternatives other than all or nothing to go with the $20 million NEC integration plan versus 35 million plus incremental real estate expense plan.

So just let me reinforce my statement that we had a good first quarter, it’s good to be back where we should have been and with the NEC integration behind us we feel very good about the momentum that we have gone through and what’s ahead of us. And I’d like to go through our scoreboard and mention some of the major events during the quarter.

Even though you read them in the press release, let me just highlight and because I think these are the real drivers of our business and you’re going to constantly hear from all of us when we talk about margins, margins and margins. And we’re going to show you that we are serious about it, we’re going to show you that that this company has turned around and we all remember 2008 and everything that happened from this time but we got our act together here and the winds behind our back and you’ll see some of these results and what we’re talking about today.

We talk about EBITDA, the results were 38.7 million, we are up 5.2% for the quarter versus last year and most of these improvements were driven by stronger performance with our envelope operation. Keep in mind that the whole strategy of the NEC purchase and integration was to take this company who had no margins, no profits, no results and convert that into a 10% margin operation at the end of this year. That was our goal to achieve and you’ll be seeing some of those results today.

Number two, we’ve been telling you that we’re doing a better job and selecting higher margin customers and we’ve been working on this. We’ve talked about it constantly and all our staff meetings, we are looking at customers that we’ve had agreements with for some time summer contracts that go out for a period of time and we’ve going to this customers and talked about better margin improvement and the fact that we had to have to do that and at the same time, we had fewer envelope plans. After the integration which gave us a revenue of $475 million for the quarter, which is pretty damn good considering what was happening and what was going on. But the sales number is down and the consolidation of some of the plans with accelerations and the integration is definitely happen and it’s a good thing to happen and we continue to have success with our customers on getting better pricing.

Item three, our envelope 250 margin goal was 10%. At the end of the year, that is what we want to be measured on. Our first quarter envelope margin results were 9.2%. And you look at you say well, what’s going on there, that’s a lay down and what is that no, we had a very good quarter, 9.2% -- a very good job for the quarter with our envelope group and the management team.

Item four on the score board, we also generated solid operational performances out of our print group as well as our label and packaging group and solid performance around the horn with all of our different operations including the corporate side of the business.

Item five, all of our plan margins have showing improvement for in quarter to include the NEC locations and I might add that Andy Johnson and his team have been doing an outstanding job. On our performance goals for the first quarter not only for the NEC integrations but all of our plants that they above that really made a difference of achieving and improving on all of our statistical goals on what happens in our plans.

Item six, our consolidated margins last year for the quarter were 7.5% for the first quarter. This year, we are 8.1% for the quarter and that is good progress and we’ll continue to see progress as the year goes. Strategically we sort of move through the year with the improvements on the margins.

So that’s all I want to say about 2015 and our performance expect that we delivered our 2015 commitments to you, our investors and we plan to deliver our second quarter. We are just in the process of closing the first month of the second quarter and that looks favorable and we feel good about that. And we really have hands on team that is very much in turn with our results on a daily basis and we feel good about that.

And I would like to say that is all I have and in the past we always start with our CFO and that’s Scott Goodwin, who is going to talk about the financial results of our company and all the many other improvement projects he has been working on. He and his team have been working on several projects over the last year, year and half to improve our financials. You will be hearing the same thing from Rob and I think you ought to note this because we not only have delivered some first quarter, we’re delivering quality results and if you look through some of the things we are doing, they have a longer and lasting effect.

So with that, I’ll turn it over to Scott. Scott?

Scott Goodwin

Thank you Mr. Burton and good morning everyone. Today I am going to review our first quarter 2015 financial results, discuss financial highlights from the quarter and provide an update on our key cash flow items.

Turning to our results of operations for the first quarter, net sales were 475.1 million compared to 490.1 million in the prior year. This decrease in net sales was primarily due to the consolidation of our envelope facilities over the course of the past year in connection with the National Envelope asset acquisition. This decline was partially offset by mix and pricing improvements associated with our envelope operations combined with higher sales from our label business.

Our gross profit for the quarter increased 2.3 million or 3% as compared to the same prior year period primarily due to the impacts of our National Envelope integration plan that was completed throughout 2014. As a result, our gross margin increased from 15.3% in the prior year to 16.3% in the first quarter of 2015.

SG&A expenses for the first quarter declined 3.2 million over the same prior year period primarily due to lower acquisition and integration cost related to National as well as cost controls within our other product lines. Our SG&A as a percent of sales was 11% in 2015 as compared to 11.3% in 2014. Restructuring and other charges for the first quarter were 4.4 million compared to 5.9 million in the prior year. Net cash restructuring and integration for the quarter was 2.2 million compared to 5.8 million in the prior year period. We anticipate net cash restructuring and integration for 2015 will be inline with our previous guidance of approximately $10 million.

Interest expense for the first quarter decreased 2.2 million to 25.7 million from 27.9 million in the prior year. This decrease was due to a lower weighted average interest rate of over 0.5% to 7.2% as compared to 7.8% in the prior year. Cash paid for interest was 28.6 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 25.9 million in the prior year. I would like to mention as we head through the next couple of quarters given the refinancing that we completed in June of last year, we expect our cash interest to vary significantly compared to prior year.

As an example, our 2014 second quarter cash interest was 41.9 million, which included accelerated payments in connection with the refinancing. That compares to a forecast for the second quarter of 2015 of approximately $16 million.

Further given the repurchases of our 11.5% note so far this year, we currently expect cash interest for the full year will be less than the original guidance of $90 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was 38.7 million, an increase of 1.9 million or 5.2% from the prior year of 36.8 million.

Turning to our cash flow highlights for the quarter, cash use and continuing operating activities was 7.4 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to a use of cash of 3.4 million in the prior year. I would like to point out that given our cash flow generation primarily from the timing of billings to and collections from our customers, we had approximately $12 million of cash on hand classified as a reduction of accounts payable this quarter due to class reclassification accounting rules.

We experiences due to our cash management practices are minimizing our primary borrowings under our ABL facility, which affords us a lower cash interest exposure by locking into lower rate LIBOR contracts. Given the cash flow generation during the quarter, we repaid all of our outstanding primary borrowings and as such did not want to break the LIBOR contract to further pay down the outstanding ABL balance at the end of the quarter.

Had there been prime borrowings outstanding, we would’ve experienced a source of cash from continuing operating activities for the quarter. We expect to continue to drive working capital improvements and will report on them further as the year progresses. Cash paid for pension and post for time and plans in the first quarter of 2015 was 3.1 million compared to 3.3 million in 2014.

As discussed on the last call with the change in pension funding requirements, we expect to pay over $7 million less in contributions for our pension and post-retirement plans in 2015 as compared to 2014 and we begin to see that reduction with our second quarter payment activity.

To give you specifics, during the last nine months in 2014, we paid out 10.7 million of our contributions as compared to an anticipated payoff in 2015 for that same time period of 3.5 million. Also remember that given the actuarial loss in the prior year, our pension expense will be up approximately $5 million in 2015 versus 2014 of which 1.2 million impacted our first quarter 2015 results.

Cash paid for income taxes for both the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 was less than half a million dollars. Cash flows related to investing activities for the first quarter of 2015 reflect net capital expenditures of 5.5 million. We expect net CapEx for the year to be in line with our previous guidance of $20 million to $25 million.

Cash flows related to financing activates for the first quarter of 2015 primarily reflect our cash flow generation during the quarter being used to fund the repurchases of our 11.5% notes as well as the incremental borrowing capacity of $10 million on our ABL facility that we received with our amendment earlier this year.

In closing, we are pleased with our first quarter results and continue to see positive trends early in the second quarter. While there continues to be a lot of activity within our organization the disruption from our envelope consolidation seems to be in our rearview mirror and we expect to continue to experience positive momentum against our prior year performance particularly as move into the back half for the year.

We will continue to manage our cost effectively and look to improve our working capital position further as we move throughout the year, which allow us to utilize our cash generation for debt repayments and reinvestments into our operating platform.

And with that, I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Burton.

Robert Burton

Thank you, Scott, good job. And now I’d like Rob Burton, our President. He is going to be talking about our capital structures and what’s going on with the industry.

Robert Burton

Thank you very much. I’ll provide a brief update on some strategic initiatives that we’ve been working on and a brief update on some of the industry consolidation and an opportunity that are out there right now. So with the completion in the NEC integration and the cost associate with that transaction firmly behind us now, we believe the 2015 would be a much stronger year for cash flow generation and would serve as a launching pad for us to achieve our objective readdressing higher cost interest debt.

Our results so far this year are demonstrating that we are well on our way delivering on these goals. Since the start of this year, we distinguished over $22 million of 11.5% notes leaving us with the balance of under $200 million today. This alone represents an interest savings annually of approximately $3 million.

Going forward, we will continue to allocate our access cash flow to continue to low our debt and again we will focus on a higher costs instruments. We have a restricted payment basket that continues to grow and that we attend on using over the course of the year. We are also currently monitoring the capital markets and depending on results of our strategic review which I will address next, you will look to potentially filed holistic solution or subordinated debt that becomes callable starting next week.

As we have seen much of late, there have been several large M&A events in our industry such in the packaging, retail and books basis. We’ve been very encouraged by the transaction multiples that have been printed and are near-historical highs. As we have said before a while, we think industry consolidation will continue and will accelerate over the next few years. We still believe that potential asset sales at the appropriate evaluation will be value creating for our shareholders.

Since our last conference call, we’ve made substantial progress with our review. While this process has been deliberate and done at a measured pace, we believe that we’re in position to offer much more clarity over the coming months and we have no assurances regarding the outcome can be made, we’re hopeful that at the end, this process will be value creating for our investors.

As I turn it back to Mr. Burton, I want to echo his comments that we are very pleased that first quarter results and remained enthusiastic about our 2015 outlook. The significant improvement in margins of more than 200 basis points in our envelope group that we saw in the first quarter versus a very tough comp in 2014 first quarter gives us reinforcement that the fact that we’ve taken hard actions and cost reductions are showing improvement in our results.

The significant improvement in cash flow that we expect for 2015 is to get into come together and remains number one focus as continue throughout the year.

And with that, I’ll turn it back to you.

Robert Burton

Thank you, Rob, very good. And now I like to have Mike Burton, our Chief Executive Officer, who is going to talk about field sales update and also what’s going on with our platform sales. Michael?

Michael Burton

Great, thank you very much. Today, I’ll give you an update on each of our business units and then I’ll discuss the continued success and expansion of our platform sale initiatives. The first thing I need to discuss is envelope. In the first quarter, our envelope grew performed very well, highlighted by EBITDA margins north of of 9%. We believe after considering integration from last year that our net sales grew in the first quarter. This is driven by favorable product mix and price increases to our customers.

We also continue to see improve run speeds well lowering our cost to produce across all of our facilities. We are focused on continuing that trend for the remainder of the year. Direct Mail continued to perform well in the first quarter, industry data points of 4% growth in mailing versus prior year and our performance is inline with trend. We are also seeing the real benefits of our national footprint and our ability to move work around the platform to solve of our demanding client needs and lead times.

We also continue to be proved with our stability in our print segment. In the first quarter, our revenue was effectively flat versus prior year. We’ve add some key wins and some also key renewals that works better about as well. This represents nearly $90 million of revenue that we’ll see over the next three years and these renewals will serve as an anchor to our print business. The label business had solid performance and in-spite of the fact that we were impacted severely by weather events. In fact, our most profitable facility was forced to close its stores for two days in the quarter due to state of emergencies called by the weather.

We are focused on organic growth in this segment and our e-commerce and investments and initiatives are beginning to pay real dividends. Our packaging group’s first quarter performance was better than expected, this group is focused on on-boarding new wins into the platform while continuing to reduce costs. We believe these new wins will have a real impact in the back half results.

On the platform selling, we believe that our largest opportunities to sale more of our products to our existing customers and over the last 12 months, we’ve made investments in the people, process, training and technology that allow us to grow and to being a strategic partner and set of a commodity seller. We feel that this is approach is the way of the future and will continue to invest in this.

Our leaders of our platform selling initiative are Cappy Childs, David Law and Dusty McGuire, three of the best in the industry and we are very lucky to have them. And closing we are pleased with our first quarter performance, excited about our plan for the remainder of the year and excited to be well in the Q2.

With that, I’ll turn the call back to you.

Robert Burton

Thank you, Michael. I might add that our success of hiring new executives have been very meaningful outstanding people with good background through becoming part of our team and we’ll make a stronger as they get into their new jobs and get the things done and need to be done.

So as you know, I’ve stated in the past that on forecasting that we feel very comfortable with the range concept that we have on forecasting consider one number and we’re just not smart enough to be able to figure out what the one number is. So we gave the range this past year and I said, I think we had it in our press release that we reaffirmed our full year guidance but just in case that you might to forget they had lost it somewhere on the way to work, let me just sort of mention with our guidance is again, if you look at the full year, we were talking about margins between 9.5% and 10% for the full year talking about CapEx between $20 million and $25 million, sales at about 1.9 billion as we continue to try to improve and upgrade some of our customer accounts and EBITDA with the range of 175 to 190.

So again EBITDA 175, 190 sales, 1.9 billion CapEx 20 million to 25 million and margins 9.5 to 10. That’s our relook at the year and we feel good about that now and most of the gentlemen here I’ve mentioned that we are close to good quarter and we’re on a way for a good second quarter.

So with that operator, I’d like you to open up the call as I am looking at our clock that runs some of the time here in the building and it looks like it’s about 30 minutes into the call. So operator, why don’t you open the call for Q&A, please?

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Yes. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Lance Vitanza with CRT Capital Group.

Lance Vitanza

On the working capital front, it sounds like you had an additional 12 million essentially of debt repayment that got taken out of cash flow from financing and stuffed into cash flow of operations. Is that right, I mean, it looks to us like you generated 4.5 million of cash flow, I think you mentioned, versus a burn of 3.5 million last year. I am wondering if you had any of that the same dynamic in 1Q 2014 or should we be thinking this was really kind of like $8 million organic improvement year-over-year in cash flow?

Scott Goodwin

Lance, this is Scott, I will answer that question. I think you hit the nail on the head there. If the reclassification doesn’t happen and/or we unfortunately we are hamstrung by the accounting rules to do that. But I think generally speaking typically – the key to this is the primary borrowings underneath the ABL. So we’re obviously focused on cash flow generation. So we’ve tightened that a bit and entered into our LIBOR contract and at the same time we’ve been committing and our focus to getting working capital out. So those two things came together here in the first quarter rather quickly and literally within the first week of the second quarter we use that money to go ahead and pay down the ABL. So that's why you see the ABL grossed up where it is in the financials.

Lance Vitanza

Okay, thanks. And then just back on the business conditions, as we sit here, we are a good bit into the second quarter. On the envelope side in particular, I’m wondering are you seeing any, on the volume side, are you seeing anything that makes you concerned. I mean I know obviously the volumes are under pressure, we get that, but do we think the conditions are getting better, worse or staying about the same?

Michael Burton

This is Mike, thanks Lance. The question, if you look back at the last few quarters direct mail has been good. Q4 of last year, they had high-single-digit growth and we talked about 4% direct mail growth or mailing growth in the first quarter. We see trend staying in that line, we continue to see more people issuing credit cards and that behavior is going to continue we believe for the remainder of the year. But at least for now, we’re saying stable market and stable environment that’s number what we seen in Q1.

Lance Vitanza

How big a drag do you have from the office catalog side given the M&A that is taking place there?

Michael Burton

Standard drive nothing unusual, that business performs has been stable over the year, its not the same behavior we’ve seen here in the first quarter as well, profit improvement.

Robert Burton

Well, it’s Bob. comment to that, we become pretty well sophisticated on looking at our backlog, to answer that question. So we sort of judge that -- we have a grasp of that inventory and where we’re add on sales and what’s coming through the pipeline, I lot better than we did several years ago. So we can sort of estimate where we’re looking at ahead of time we’re in the past, were grabbing around trying to do different kinds of things. Anyone else want to add anything on the inventory?

Robert Burton

No, only I’ll add Lance, which gives us some comfort that the mail volumes should remain stronger remain in part of the year is that postal reform is hopefully on its way, there has been the nine increases sort of announced remain in part of this year and in terms of sort of other input costs such as paper have been relatively flattish maybe trending down a little bit as well. So I think that’s encouraging that goes well for our customers and what they are trying to accomplish so we remain confident that t this strength is still going down the tracks right.

Robert Burton

Yes, versus like three price increases like about a week ago.

Lance Vitanza

I only other question I have is on the energy on the input side. I know that prices obviously seem to be off the bottom, but did you get any favorable impact, or are you likely to get any favorable impact from lower energy prices? I think when I asked the question last quarter you sort of suggested that you probably would, but that you’re the last guys to feel it. Where do we stand on that?

Robert Burton

I think the way to answer is, again, we are the last guy down that food chain and low and behold, oil expected 60 bucks today. So we have seen the minimums amount if any I think fuel costs were there down transportations is very tight, so we’re actually the rates are going up. In terms of other commodity costs, it has been relatively flat. Is there any market or so repay let energy costs? Sure, but there’s other markets that are tight. So think on all of our probably where we talk we’re going to be in this pretty much flattish.

Operator

And your next question comes from Kevin Cohen with Imperial Capital.

Kevin Cohen

As you look ahead given the changes in the mix in the envelope group, as well as the consolidation being done at this point in time, I guess, what do you think the blended unit volume declines might be and is there room for margins to actually exceed that 10% goal just given the change in mix being a bit more favorable?

Scott Goodwin

Kevin, this is Scott, I’ll start with that. I think it’s a very difficult measure. As you can imagine we are down eight facilities versus the prior year and we’re looking at probably millions of envelope units that moved into existing facility.

So it’s something that we’re working to, I think it’s a lot better as you move throughout the year comparable-wise but to answer your question, the goal here is to get to that 10% margin. So I mean you’ve heard a lot of dialogue here today, that’s working with our customers not only just going to them with price increases, but also working with them on the relationship side and lowering input costs on our end as well. So it’s a united effort here.

Robert Burton

We got a long history here. Historically, we’re use to with our backgrounds and different other companies, we’re use to measurements on EBIT and not EBITDA. And we got here, we found out the measurement was probably more EBITDA than it should have been EBIT.

So we all agreed that we would focus on trying to get our margins, starting where we’re at and it was hard to even find them when we first got here but sort of made some amendments and got into that mid 5% range. And then we said, we should be a 10% EBITDA margin company and that is a level that mixes get to some satisfaction, but really long-term we want to be an EBIT kind of producer and that’s going to take several year.

So this year it’s 10% and we’re looking at that as a consolidated business and we talk about it constantly with everybody. And the fact that is a major month that people have to get to be successful with us. And then hopefully when we get that done we’re going to try to move that along and start looking at the capital. In part of that, where we look at the EBIT portion and mix as hopefully accelerate our whole kind of measurement performance. But 10 is not where we want to end up, but we want to get better, but we need approved to you and other analysts that we can deliver 10 on a consistent basis.

We get some it’s like, you’ve got three kids and one of them is always sick and that just way it is. I mean we will have terrific performance and then the next month something will have happen that will screw it up and then we come back and try to get it but I think we’re for real now on the consistent basis because some of our problem, Charles were down at a 5 or 6 several months ago and we’ve got those up to whether more respectable and I just think it’s a slow climb, it’s really a slow climb and I think all of the managers are really striving. When I said margins, margins it’s margins, margins but it’s also how we get to where we need to be long-term and that’s going to be EBIT plus.

Kevin Cohen

And then two other quick questions. I guess there’s been a little bit of chatter that Pemex might look to enter into the U.S. markets. What competitive implications, if any, might that have for Cenveo?

Scott Goodwin

Its Rob hear, again I think there margins are pretty strong. So, I think they can bring discipline to the marketplace and take that -- towards the across the industry role forward,. But again they are much smaller. We are a $1 billion enterprise. They are probably $100 million plus. So again we have heard chatter from a lot of people before entering the market over the year and we’ll see what happens here. But if more competitors could be like them, we like it.

Robert Burton

And it is interesting, you heard that rumor because they couldn’t ways get out of America and get over the Canada when I have a long time ago. And they are a very performance-driven operations but it’s not easier to run a $100 million operations and there is a $1 billion operation. But I think what we want margins and prices are good for us and we just don’t want somebody to come and start given away like we’ve been based with the last four years.

Kevin Cohen

And then one last question, Rob, you talked about in the preamble about multiples in the packaging arena, et cetera being at historical highs. I guess when you look at packaging and labels and some of the other areas, what sort of absolute levels are you seeing currently in the market out of curiosity?

Robert Burton

Again almost say they’re back to the crossing us they were have a couple of years, but I think they are, I think we seen some transactions on the smaller side go up approximately eight times and some of the large public ones that we all probably know about are north of 10. So it’s very healthy, I think it sort of speak to the trend of the business and sort of the opportunity going forward. So I think we’re encouraged by that.

Kevin Cohen

That’s very helpful. Thanks. And continued best of luck and nice quarter.

Robert Burton

Thanks Kevin.

Operator

And the next question comes from Charlie Strauzer with CJS Securities.

Charlie Strauzer

Most of the questions have been answered, but just kind a little bit more of taking up on the previous discussion about operational performance improvements and maybe if you can talk a little bit more there about, with the new plant kind of running along, it sounds like you are well underway with the integration here. What other things can you be doing to further improve the operations there? And then also too talk a little bit more about the uses of cash flow for the remainder of the year. Thanks.

Robert Burton

Charlie, I’m going to say two words and then I will turn it over to Mike here. I think of all the years of everything with sales.com to you name it the level of sophistication and that not only us, but other competitors are using today is really remarkable. When we can look screens and look out for three or four months and actually look at the customer names and the dollar and the volume and expand the whole thing that we’re trying to do is really a change. I think that and the fact that we have gone out with and really has been driven by the platform selling group as getting larger every day improving the quality of our sales individuals through a very focused about making money and achieving targets and is the best time I have ever seen since I’ve been in this business and I’m not saying because it’s here but I think the focus and the whole management team that will -- just to give you an example Mike setting around across in table from where and his CFO is on the other side have been looking at everyone of these numbers everyday that we get Cliff now from out in the field. So Mike why don’t you jump in and give a little flavor of what you and Cliff do every day that would give him comfort or on top of some of these forecast.

Michael Burton

Sure, I think it’s the cycle of integration and last year we went through all the heavy lifting in all those pieces. In the first quarter, you get really focused on operational excellences and discipline and the things we look at on a daily basis and it’s not only myself and another here, it's more important the people on the press, if you look at their run speed per minute, they’re look at the labor metrics, what cost to produce about envelopes and they look at inventory turns and those things may sound simple and trivial but they are not because people are measured on, I mean they evaluated on, I mean they can earn compensation on improving those results. And that’s we’re add, we’re seeing facilities out there that are improving the run speed 10% from beginning of the year.

And we think, we continue to that trend and it’s just focused on day in and day out not worrying about what your plan and what your practice is going and whoever think from an integration but really focusing on the core opportunities within then your facility and that’s what we’ve done well in the first quarter, we’re just now starting to see some of those benefits. So we feel strongly that will continue to see it throughout the remainder of the year.

On the cash flow I think again our number one, number two, number three sort of use of cash it’s paying down debt, we’re going to focused as we had in Q1 on the higher cost debt that sort of the plan for the foreseeable future.

Operator

Thank you. And your next question comes from Jamie Clement with Macquarie.

Jamie Clement

Bob, a lot of emphasis on the 4Q call on the print group. You guys had an outstanding quarter then. Less emphasis on this call. Is that a function of just the seasonal malaise that some of those product lines go into in Q1? Are you still pleased with the progress of that group and do you expect a good year?

Robert Burton

Mike, why don’t you jump in already?

Michael Burton

No, our performance in the fourth quarter was strong in our revenue side. Now first quarter was solid as well, I mean we’re flat on the top and effectively there on the bottom and there is ups or downs seen all the facilities we have. So I don’t think that if we are down in the business at all, I think it’s a solid performance for us and if we can continue to be flat to grow slightly that’s what we’re trying to do in that end in the marketplace but our focus right across the board, but if you look at envelope from we’re talking more about that, because we’re really excited about the improvements we’ve seen there, but we are solid in print, as solid as we have been.

Robert Burton

We never talk about customer names but I can give you 20 of outstanding sales that we've been able to deliver. And sometimes we are just holding our breath that they’re as good as actually look, but we’ve been doing an outstanding job. But sometime it just the cycle of what’s going on and we’re focuses and what are the bigger parts that happens. But no, I would tell you someone comes in to you and talks about the business, which is good and which is bad. You’re always going to have some that are up one month and some that are down. It just the way it is. And but no, there is no primary focus about anything one way or the other. There all the same and we’re trying to get the maximum results out of all them.

Jamie Clement

Bob, do you think, in talking about the print group, do you think that after let’s say seven, eight years of a lot of businesses failing, a lot of mergers, a lot of consolidations, whatever you want to call it, has it gotten to the point where things may be starting to stabilize a little bit from a pricing perspective and may be near 10 years of consolidation, all of that it is finally starting to the survivors are finally starting to maybe do a little bit better?

Robert Burton

Well, I will tell you, I’ve been in this business for 30 years and 10 on 40 all together. And I have never seen the strategy that is consistent from one year to another. And we’ve had outstanding sales in all of these markets, I remember how successfully we were at George Rice at World Color and some of the other companies when we had all the commercial on the print side, when everyone looked at the car book strategy and who had what and how many annual reports we were going to get and those businesses just changed dramatically, there is no focused on that now at all, it’s based to lose a new customer, what is a new account, who is doing what and you just see a whole flip-flop.

Even though we do and I think, I don’t think, I know we’re lead in the car books, I mean for us quality and stuff but I don’t talk about that, I mean we talk about some of these major accounts that we have that could be 20 to 15, the $25 million in size as I think that’s really probably the bigger change with us. We have many, many, many more larger accounts than we’ve add in the past. What do you say Mike?

Michael Burton

Yes, our national footprint protects us.

Scott Goodwin

What you have see reason and Jamie that’s on the East Coast they’ve been plays that have gone out and they’ve been heavily weighed in one or two product segments. Where we have I think a national footprint and we’re able to diversify in that regard. So we never leave and by the way each of this facility is not just one quarter product we’ve run there. Our multiple products who run on different kind of equipment. So we have a lot of protection and diversity within each of our facilities let alone our national platform.

Jamie Clement

Right. And obviously national sales has been a real emphasis of yours for probably the last 24 years, did it fall right?

Michael Burton

Absolutely. And we’re putting in all together in our platform team, which allowing us to recognize some real wonder.

Jamie Clement

And I might suggest there may be more businesses going under in the Northeast in that particular line of business.

Robert Burton

We’re not considering world on it.

Operator

And next comes from Trent Porter with Guggenheim Securities.

Trent Porter

A couple questions. The first, you called out the weather impact on the labels business. As I recall, you also had a couple of other headwinds in that segment that kind of made me pleasantly surprised to see flat revenue and EBITDA. So I was wondering if the outsourcing of gum on the top line, have we already annualized that and that’s why it’s no longer having an impact, or is that having an impact? And then the second thing, as I recall, there was going to be a headwind from a lag between manufacturing efficiency and price concessions in packaging when you followed some customers offshore. And so I am wondering was that headwind in the first quarter and are these numbers, if I adjust for that, even stronger sort of staying positive going forward?

Robert Burton

Okay. I wanted to let us answer both of the Scott [indiscernible] .

Scott Goodwin

On your labels comments, the dry gum business, we exited towards the end of 2013. So you’re right the comp in ’14 was definitely noticeable. But in early part of ’14 there was no activity on that dry gum business. So that is out of the equation. I think what we’ve also seen and Mike alluded to it a little bit in his commentary is we’ve been investing pretty heavily in e-commerce in some of these other areas. So that certainly assisted us on the label side and we saw a little bit better if you will on the labels business particularly with some large retail customers here in Q1 versus the prior year. So that’s the commentary on the label side at least from year perspective.

Robert Burton

Yeah, on the label piece we have certain properties that go at high-double-digits. So I mean that’s we’re excited about not the largest pieces, but some of the smaller pieces do that now becoming really impactful which is helping offset any kind of whether events that are out there. As far as packaging whether headwinds in the first quarter sure, they were some especially on some new product launches that are just take a little longer than we expect some traction has been where we like to yet. But even with that our performance was solid. So I think that’s what you’re saying in the trail as you spoke about is there until the first quarter for us in the packaging perspective, we like what we saw even with some of the headwinds we did have to deal with.

Trent Porter

Okay, got it. And then the next question is another it may be me just getting the timing wrong, but the $3 million one-time NEC benefit that you got last year, was that in the first quarter, or should we expect that to be a headwind in one of the other quarters?

Robert Burton

Yeah there is about a million dollars of NEC related benefit in Q1 of this year. I’m not sure with $3 million number you’re talking specifically, but it was about a million dollars of upside in the Q1 number last year that is not in this number. And then you’ve got the incremental pension component as well this year. So you got a million to incremental pension expense versus last year as well.

Michael Burton

[indiscernible].

Robert Burton

Yeah, it’s 2.5 million swing, I mean…

Michael Burton

We’ve got a [indiscernible] so that’s right.

Robert Burton

So there is some normalization Trent is finalize meaningful is what we’ve talk about and telling the Q4 call coming out of the year trying to set the 2015 baseline for everybody.

Trent Porter

Got it. Okay. And then just two related questions. With the integration done…

Michael Burton

No I get one [indiscernible] electricity bills coming in. Go ahead Trent.

Trent Porter

With the integration done, have you already started sort of, I had in my mind that you would be very well-positioned to pursue share gains and maybe recapturing some of the business that you had to walk away from as a result of the acceleration of the integration. Have you started that and any progress or green shoots that you can talk about there?

Robert Burton

I think yes, last year was the year of getting the heavy lifting done and this is the year where we sort of get back, what we do back that sort of going after the marketplace. I want Mike talk about it, but yes our number one focus is now growing the business.

Michael Burton

The good news is we’ll become very good at integrating companies. And we’re obviously, we understand the market better anyone. So we’re out there obviously looking what’s going the competitive marketplace until we want to be. So we’ve been focused on our own business for now, but there’s always an eye to what else is out there and where else we can make the best return for our investor.

Robert Burton

Right. And I would also add to that, on a constant basis, we are looking at things and we have done about 80 of acquisitions and we look at constantly and we’re just trying to make sure that we want to base to get the stock price moving up and that’s our objective. We all here and out there listening. At weighted for the stock price to come and that’s our track record to be doing it and that is our number one priority and some of these acquisitions could help us. But there is risk in those things and we want to be very careful.

And as of just shortly, we’ve been looking at deals constantly, but our primary focus is to deliver our year, this year and make our investors feel comfortable with us and feel comfortable what we can do and add on. And with that ladies and gentlemen that is our day and we appreciated. And hopefully we’ll be talking to you soon. We’re talking about a good second quarter. So thank you operator, we appreciated. Very good.
