For the first quarter of 2015, we reported a net loss of $57 million or $0.35 per diluted share compared to net income of $20 million or $0.12 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2014. The first quarter 2014 includes a $15 million charge for early retirement of debt. We were facing challenging times at our industry and we’re confronting these challenges head-on. As previously announced, we cold stack five domestic rigs during the first quarter, this rings a total number of rigs, we have cold stacked this cycle to nine.

We are currently marketing nine rigs in the U.S. with six rigs fully crude. As of today, four of our domestic rigs are working. There are currently 19 jack-ups being marketed in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with just 10 under contract today. This is the lowest level of demand we have seen since the early days of the offshore industry.

The swift drop in commodity prices along with customer consolidation has combined to create a very difficult market in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We expect to see continued pressure on both utilization and day rates, particularly, as we enter the hurricane season.

We have taken proactive steps to right size our business our business to the current market environment. And we’ll continue to diligently watch our cost without compromising the safe and reliable services we provide to our customers. Troy will go in more detail on our cost reduction efforts but these actions will allow us to deliver significant operating cost savings while still maintaining some capacity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that can respond quickly when market conditions improve.

Moving on with the international drilling segment. Over this month, we announced the five-year contract on the Hercules 260 working for Eni in West Africa. The day rates start just 75,000 per day and could rise up to 125,000 per day based on oil prices. This is a good contract in a difficult environment, and we are very pleased this rig will have a home for the next five years. The linked oil price allows us to give us some concession to our customers when oil prices are low, but to participate in the upside when oil prices recover.

The 260 contract is only one of a handful of new international contracts signed year-to-date. So far this year, there have only been 21 new contracts signed outside of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico compared to 43 over the same period last year.

The limited number of new contracts, coupled with the addition of new builds entering the market have led to a decline in industry utilization. Over the past year, utilization for the marketed jack up fleet outside of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico has fallen from 96% to 86%. While it is unlikely if no new jack up contracts or extensions are awarded for the rest of this year, international utilization rates could fall to less than 50% by year-end.

Based on the combination and the number of rigs that have contracts expiring during 2015, and in addition to the 54 new build jack up deliveries, only three of which have contracts. This lack of activity, couple with an increase in rig availabilities has made it challenging to find new work for international rigs. The Hercules 267 recently finished a job in West Africa and we’re currently marketing the rig in the region.

The Hercules 208 completed its campaign in India mid-February and has mobilized to Malaysia to warm stacked. There is a long-term tender for a mat-supported rig that come out of India soon which the 208 will be well-suited for. But the tender will be competitively priced.

The Hercules Triumph has completed its shipyard state, it’s now fully operative for work in the Central North Sea. There are some opportunities in the North Sea but they will all be very competitive. We have a competitive bid on the Triumph in the region, which if successful, could start in mid-2015.

Outside of this opportunity, we are in discussion with other operators in the region. Although start date for these opportunities are likely to slip to later in to 2015, are pushing to 2016. The Resilience is idle in Gabon today. We are aggressively marketing rig in West Africa and elsewhere around the world.

Our three rigs in the Middle East continue to work for Aramco and perform well. As we have previously disclosed, we received the notice of termination for the Hercules 261, which is effective March 27. We have since received an extension will keep the rig on contract though April 30. We have maintained a productive dialogue with Aramco throughout this process and are hopeful it will be able to come to an agreement that will keep all three rigs working for Aramco for many years.

However, we’re still in the middle of that discussion and nothing has been finalized. And I can’t comment any further at this point. I will say that we understand and value our long-term relationship. We have been consistently providing Aramco with quality service since first working for them in 2009. We will, of course, give the market an update as soon as we finalize our future plans.

Finally, construction on the Hercules Highlander is progressing on schedule, and we are working with Maersk very closely to oversee that process. The queue was laid on the 4th March and hollow blocks are being erected in the dry dock, which is progressing ahead of schedule. Fabrication of the combination blocks as well as the cantilever and drill floor has begun. And the artist worked over 530,000 man hours without a recordable incident. Jurong has been doing a great job for us. Overall, we have completed about 22% of that project scope and are exactly where we want to be, on track for delivery in April of 2016.

I meet with Maersk Senior Management regularly as their operating groups. Maersk continues to affirm their commitment to the development of the [ph] Culzean Field, where the rig will be working in the importance of our relationship. We look forward to putting this rig to work for them on time and on budget.

Moving on to International Liftboats business, utilization for our liftboats in Nigeria remains weak, as the low commodity prices and reported 30% to 40% CapEx reduction at NNPC, the Nigerian National Oil Company, has severely impacted activity in the regions. Our customers who partnered with NNPC have, in turn, look to us for price concessions.

We recently agreed to a 10% pricing discount with a major customer in Nigeria. We remain guarded with our utilization expectations. Two of our larger boats in West Africa, the Bull Ray and Tiger Shark spent most of the first quarter in shipyard are now available for work.

On the positive side, Nigeria has recently completed its presidential election with the peaceful transition of power. We view this as a positive for the long-term political climate, but near-term activity could remain low as the new administration transitions into their new roles.

In the Middle East, we had two vessels that spent time in the shipyard during the first quarter. Kingfish finished its yard stay in late February, and is now back to work. And the Amberjack would complete its liftboat later next month with some prospects for near-term work. So far, activity levels and inquiries for liftboats in the Middle East had stayed resilient, despite the drop in oil price.

That concludes my review of worldwide operating conditions.

As you can tell from my remarks, 2015 will clearly be challenging. My sense it will take some time for activity levels to recover even if oil prices rebound later this year. In this environment, we will seek utilization wherever there is work.

We are making significant efforts to right-size our cost structure. Over the course of the last several months, we have cold-stacked nine rigs and implemented a number of other measures to reduce our spending.

A global workforce has been reduced by almost 40%. The personnel decisions have been very difficult as these are our friends and colleagues, they have contributed to the success of our business over the past several years. But unfortunately, these are actions we have to take. We will continue to aggressively look for ways to reduce our spending but not at the expense of our safety performance or our operating efficiency which our customers have come to expect.

Year-to-date, we have had a loss time incidents and our liftboat fleet is operated over two years incident-free. We only control the safety of our people and our cost, and we are doing both very well. We have seen the benefits of these cost control efforts in our first quarter results and expect continued improvement this year, which Troy will provide a further guidance on his remarks.

With that lead in, let me turn the call over to Troy.

Troy Carson

Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. As normal, my comments today will focus on a sequential comparison of our quarterly results. I’ll also provide an update to our operating cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for Q&A.

For the first quarter, we reported a net loss of $57.1 million $0.35 per share. This compares to an adjusted net loss of $37.1 million or $0.23 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014, which excludes an impairment charge of $117 million or $0.73 per share related to the cold stacking of five rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. EBITDA for the first quarter QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION approximately $7.3 million, down from fourth quarter EBITDA of $35.5 million, excluding the previously mentioned impairment charge.

The decline in EBITDA was driven lower utilization and day rates. However, we are pleased to see the continued impact of our cost reduction measures. We have shown significant improvement in our operating cost in the first quarter with a 23% reduction from fourth quarter levels and a 29% decline year-over-year and we will continue to monitor our cost structure and push for greater efficiencies wherever possible.

Moving on to our segment results beginning with domestic offshore. The segment reported operating income of $3.8 million, down from fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $12.8 million, which again excludes the aforementioned asset impairment charge. The decline was driven by lower average day rates and utilization, partially offset by reduced operating expenses.

Average revenue per day decreased to $99,000 in the first quarter from $106,000 per day in the previous quarter. We ended the first quarter with five Hero marketed rigs versus the prior quarter and utilization of those marketed rigs declined to 60% compared to 64% in the fourth quarter.

Domestic offshore operating expenses declined 39% to $36 million from $59.3 million in the fourth quarter. Operating costs were below our prior guidance, largely reflecting greater savings on labor and repair and maintenance expenses driven by the cold stacking of four rigs early in the fourth quarter and five additional rigs earlier this year.

We expect to see further realized cost savings related to the cold and warm-stacked rigs in our domestic fleet as some of these cost reduction measures can take 60 to 90 days before they are fully reflected in our results.

As discussed on our last call, by cold stacking our domestic rigs, we can lower the operating cost per rig to approximately $2,000 to $2,500 per day down from almost 40,000 per day for a full crude marketed rig. In addition, we can reduce the cost on the warm stacked rigs to around $7,500 to $9,000 per day as these rigs will carry a much smaller crew complement.

As we have done in past cycles, we will continue to push for improvement in our spending efficiency and we can see further reductions in our operation cost but borrowing the stacking of additional marketed rig, the largest impacts have already been reflected in our results over the past two quarters. With that in mind, we expect domestic offshore operating cost to be in the low to mid $30 million range during the second quarter.

Our international offshore segment reported an operating loss of $20.9 million compared to a loss of $11 million in the fourth quarter. Average day rate increased to 150,000 in the first quarter from 132,000 in the prior quarter due in part to the demobilization fee of $4.5 million received for the Hercules 208 following its contract conclusion as well as full quarter realization of higher day rates on the Hercules 261 and 262 as they rolled the new contracts in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Utilization decreased to 48% from 67% in the fourth quarter driven by the Hercules 208 coming off contract in February. Idle time on the Hercules resilience and scheduled time down for equipment recertification on the Hercules 262.

Operating expenses declined slightly to $50.2 million from $54 million in the fourth quarter. First quarter expenses were in line with guidance and included approximately $2 million of cost associated with the mobilization of the Hercules 208 from India to Malaysia. We expect international offshore operating cost to remain in the mid $40 million to low $50 million range for the second quarter.

Turning to our Liftboat segment. The segment reported an operating loss of $400,000 compared to operating income of $1 million in the fourth quarter, impacted largely by downtime for scheduled maintenance on our larger vessels, partially offset by lower operating costs. Average revenue per day decreased to $23,000 from $28,000, largely due in part to a shift in revenue mix to smaller vessels.

Utilization declined slightly to 38% from 41%. Operating expenses declined by 17% to $13.5 million from $16.1 million in the previous quarter, primarily driven by cost reduction measures related to our shore-based operations. Second quarter operating expenses are expected to be in the $14 million to $16 million range.

Moving on to other income statement and cash flow items. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter were $15.8 million, slightly below our previous guidance and an improvement from our 2014 average of almost $19 million per quarter. We expect G&A to be in the $15 million to $17 million range for the second quarter.

Depreciation and amortization expense declined to $37.2 million from $42.8 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower depreciation from the rigs we recently impaired in the Domestic Offshore segment. We expect depreciation to be just under the $40 million range for the second quarter. Interest expense was stable at $25 million, and we expect second quarter to be at similar levels.

Moving on to income taxes. In the first quarter, we had cash taxes totaling $3.5 million. All of this was due to our operations in foreign jurisdictions. Looking forward, our cash taxes could fluctuate dramatically, depending on our revenues and the countries where we operate. For the second quarter, we are currently estimating cash taxes in a similar range or slightly below our first quarter level.

Capital and dry-docking expenditures were approximately $31 million during the first quarter. For the remainder of this year, we expect to spend between $90 million and $100 million which is in line with our previous guidance.

With respect to our balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the first quarter with $218 million of cash in equivalence and $143 million of availability under our $150 million revolving credit facility. Earlier this month, we made interest payments totaling $32 million and our cash balance today stands at approximately $180 million.

In May, we'll make the next installment payment on the Hercules Highlander which is approximately $24 million. Cash collections from receivables were strong again in the first quarter. Cash generation from working capital totaled $56 million during the quarter. We expect working capital to remain as a source of cash in the second quarter but the amount will moderate as our business begins to stabilize at lower revenue levels.

Finally, we continue to evaluate several options to enhance the ability of the company to handle the current industry downturn and put us in the best position for future growth. While we have many paths open to us today, we recognized that some of these choices are only available for a finite time. But we have not yet decided on the course of action. And because of that, I do not have any details to discuss in my prepared remarks nor in the Q&A. What I will say is we have historically kept strong liquidity through our all parts of the cycle.

Our focus now is on maintaining a strong liquidity position, understanding that our absolute debt levels and carrying cost of that debt as well as the uncertainties in our business going forward are significant determinant of what the appropriate level of liquidity should be for our business.

With that, we're now ready to open the call for questions. Operator?

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Praveen Narra from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.

Praveen Narra

Hey. Good morning, guys.

John Rynd

Good morning.

Troy Carson

Hello.

Praveen Narra

You guys have done a real good job in managing cost, particularly, on your domestic side. And you mentioned the difficulties and potential for very low utilization from an industry standpoint, internationally. So, I guess is there a difference in what you would need to see the cold stack international rig versus the decision from a domestic rig standpoint?

John Rynd

Yes. I think, we’ll look as we are with the two rigs a good example. We have work coming forward looks like have an operator that needs on that rig, so we’ll continue to keep the rig warm stacked, and we will just – it’s an evolving process. It's very fluid. If we look out and see opportunities then we’ll continue to keep the rig in a position where it can respond to a bid. But if we wake up one day, and it looks like there's going to be a dearth of opportunities for the foreseeable future, it will make us the step to cold stack. Likewise, with the 267 in West Africa, the same situation, it’s a fluid market. There's opportunities some are short-term, some have a little longer-term, but as long as we see potential opportunities, we’ll manage that warm stack cost but we will not go to cold stack.

Praveen Narra

Okay. I think the last time we talked about the Triumph and Resilience starting up in mid-to-late 2015. Any updates on the timing or discussion on rigs and if you could, any updates on day rate expectations?

John Rynd

Thank you. I think it's consistent with what was on our prepared remarks. We have opportunities that could start mid-2015, if we miss those, it could be late 2015 or into 2016 before we go to work. Day rate expectations are going to be lower than maybe we've seen recently. I think the market is getting very competitive right now. As I walk through the numbers, in my prepared remarks, there's not been many new jobs. There's been some extensions, but as far as incremental demand, it's been almost over half of what it was last year at this time, and you have about 180 jackups this year rolling off primary term with the contracts. So, it’s a very competitive market.

Praveen Narra

Great. Thank you for the color [Indiscernible].

John Rynd

Thank you.

Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Roland Morris from Cowen & Company. Please proceed.

Roland Morris

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to extend a little bit more on the cost side. But as far as internationally, are there significant differences in where you can get those costs to assuming that you do have to cold stack any of the rigs on that side? I know, obviously, you gave us a pretty good breakdown of the domestic. But just really, kind of what the process would be and what it would look like from a cost reduction standpoint because those international costs are a little bit higher, obviously, than the domestic cost at this point?

Troy Carson

Exactly. You hit round the head. As far as domestically, we have our cluster stack rigs where we can really drop costs down with lower manning, taking care of different rigs and a number of rigs. Internationally where we have the one-off stacks, take the 208, for example, we think that we could get that down to the $10,000 to $20,000 range fully cold stacked. But it really depends where you stack, best in Malaysia. In West Africa, it’d be slightly ahead of that.

Roland Morris

Okay. Thanks, Troy. And then, in terms of kind of the milestone payments on the Highlander, I know you said $24 million in May. And then, ultimately, when you take delivery of the rig, given the current environment and contract cancellations, rate reductions, just conversations and generally, kind of where things seem to be going from that side, what are the opportunities for financing linked to that contract and what’s that going to look like when you guys do take delivery of the rig.

Troy Carson

Yeah. I think it’s too early to tell exactly how that’s going to look. I mean, certainly, we’re having conversations with project finance teams and other opportunities. We think there is a market. It’s yet to be determined what the pricing will look on that and the amount. But we’re confident that by delivery date, we will have project financing in place or other types of financing.

Roland Morris

Okay. That’s all I had. Thanks, Troy.

Troy Carson

Thanks.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Lewis from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.

Gregory Lewis

Yes. Thank you, and good morning.

John Rynd

Good morning.

Gregory Lewis

John, you mentioned that the Bull Ray and Tiger Shark are now available for work coming out of the yard. If you were to think about the last couple of months and the next couple of months, with these boats now out of and ready for work, should we expect these boats to actually have some utilization or is this something more that they’re ready for work, but the things are at top in Nigeria where they could remain idle for longer than we want.

John Rynd

No. I think we’ll have kind of above what has been our stated utilization at the 30s and low 40s. They’ll be superior to that. There’s opportunities for those bigger vessels to kind of go right back where they came from basically because of the mandatory shipyard stay. So, I think our outlook on those two vessels is very solid.

Gregory Lewis

Okay. Great. And then just one on the – I guess two more from me. Were keeping a few rigs stacked in the Gulf of Mexico make sense? As we think about that, can we look at the existing rigs that are currently working in the Gulf of Mexico and just assume – it probably doesn’t make sense to have too many warm-stacked rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. I mean, so should we think that the outlook for at least a couple of these rigs that are working that roll off in let’s say the second question probably a couple. There is opportunities for some of those to keep working.

John Rynd

Yeah. I think there is opportunities for some to keep working and I think we’ll just continue on a weekly and a monthly basis to evaluate what’s the appropriate level of the warm-stacked fleet. I think as we get our cost lower on the warm stacked fleet it extends our optionality period. They not have to push it to cold stack. So, if we’re going to diligently manage the cost on the warm stacked vessel because if we keep it warm stack its reactivation cost is nominal. If you go to cold stacked, your activation cost could be a factor of 5 to 10.

So, I think there’s a trade off. There’s a balance between kind of the expenses you’re going to eat in the near-term versus the big dollars that you may face if you go in cold stacked it. So, we don’t have a set plan because the market is fluid and we had to be fluid with the market.

Gregory Lewis

Okay. Great. And then just one final one for me on the 260. I mean kind of not a contract that we’re used to seeing. I know we’ve seen some of these in the past where the rate is tied to the oil price. Is that something that in conversations that you’re having with customers, do you think that’s something that the jack-up industry as a whole we could be seeing more of over the next 12 to 24 months or it began as more like a one-off?

John Rynd

No. Well, yes and no Greg. I think that the key to having an all price length day rate contract is a duration of that contract because you’ll be working through potentially a cycle and a shift change in oil prices. So, I think it make sense on three to five year deals. On anything shorter you may not get the benefit of – if oil prices rise.

So, I think it’s something you will see, we’ve looked at in the industry for decades. I’m very proud of our marketing guys to get that across the finish line.

Gregory Lewis

Okay. Hey, thank you very much for the time, a very nice job on getting costs down.

John Rynd

Thank you.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Byron Pope from Tudor, Pickering and Holt. Please proceed with your question.

Byron Pope

Good morning, guys.

John Rynd

Good morning, Byron. How are you doing?

Byron Pope

Good. Just a quick question for you. I realized that you guys just market the rigs with Perisai. But as we think about the Perisai Pacific 102 and your eventual long-term strategy to have a presence in Southeast, maybe a bigger presence in Southeast Asia, the prospects there for that rig and given the competitive dynamics in Asia-Pac jack-up region?

John Rynd

Good question, Byron. We do want to continue to expand our footprint in the region. And on that rig, specifically, as you will know, I mean, it’s going to be a very competitive environment.

Byron Pope

Thank you. And then just a question as it relates to CapEx and thinking about the guidance for the remainder of the year. How should you think maintenance CapEx as a function of the total guidance with the CapEx for the remainder of the year?

Troy Carson

Yes. It’s about $50 million of the remaining guidance that we gave.

Byron Pope

Okay. And then last question, as it relates to working capital, you mentioned it likely continues to be – all right. I guess, it continues to be a source of cash as we step to the next couple of quarters. And just wondering how much more you have there in terms of [indiscernible] to pull on the working capital front?

Troy Carson

Yeah. I mean, obviously, we’re managing our payables to the extent we can, and we’re working with our customers to accelerate payment to the extent we can, of course, with some of the large international agencies that we work with. Sometimes that’s more difficult than you can imagine. So, it’s going to be hard for me to really give you an indication what Q2 comp is. But we do think Q2 could produce positive working capital cash flow. But after that, I think with the – from the level that we're at, from a revenue perspective, that will start to taper off.

Byron Pope

Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.

Troy Carson

Thank you.

John Rynd

Thank you.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Dave Wilson from Howard Weil. Please proceed.

Dave Wilson

Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions.

John Rynd

Good morning, Dave.

Dave Wilson

Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the previous question on the 260. Are your marketing guys having any luck, I guess, or are you seeing other opportunities for some longer-term kind of contracts like that or is that – was that really kind of a one-off?

John Rynd

Right now it’s a one-off. But it’s a model that we're comfortable with and will explore with our various international customers that have that duration of work. Again, I think the key is just duration because then you may get – you'll play through the cycle and may achieve some of that upside.

Dave Wilson

Got you. And then just – the other question on international has already been answered but had they kind of one, Troy, as far as international DD&A, can you tell me how much of that is related to the Triumph and the Resilience on a quarterly basis?

Troy Carson

Yeah. We can pull it. We might want to just do that offline.

Dave Wilson

We can probably – yeah, exactly. Okay. All right, great. Thanks, guys. I’ll turn the call back over.

Troy Carson

Thanks.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Brown from Global Hunter. Please proceed.

Mark Brown

Hi, guys. I just was curious on the Hercules 260. What other – what was the competitive situation in bidding for that contract? And what led to your ability to win that work?

John Rynd

It was competitive. Obviously, you need five-year program – even in a bull market, it’s going to be competitive with a lot of people wanting that work. And of course, the market has started getting weak even when we started negotiating that back in the fourth quarter of 2014. I think the combination of they like the rig, the rig kind of fit what they needed, as well as I think we may have been the only guys to offer oil price link.

Mark Brown

Okay. And then, just on the Highlander, I assumed that that is going to be delivered on time and that there is no possibility of delaying that, given that you already have the contract in place with Maersk.

John Rynd

Yeah. That’s correct. A, the shipyard is right on schedule slightly, ahead on some parts of the project, so there’s no benefit to us or our customer to delay delivery.
