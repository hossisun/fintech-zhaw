as Matt note , it typically expect the first quarter to be strong for it due to seasonality , and this quarter generally follow that pattern . increment weather to northeast corridor in February help to offset the negative impact that winter storm Juno close thousand of it restaurant in January for more than the day . it end the first quarter with active diner reach 5.6 million , a 46 % year - over - year increase or 43 % without the recent acquisition . it achieve this growth even though last year be a difficult comparable period due to persist cold and snow it active diner have now more than double in the last few year but it still believe there be a substantial opportunity for active diner growth in all of market because it vast majority of diner still order take out by dial the restaurant . convert it for online take time , but it have see success in many market by actively invest brand awareness and reinforcement through different online and offline channel . with this robust growth in diner it continue to see growth in order , it process it with 235,000 daily average Grubs and nearly $ 590 million in gross food sale during the first quarter , 30 % and 36 % year - over - year increase respectively . if it exclude the impact of the two acquisition in the middle of the quarter those growth rate would have be approximately 29 % and 34 % respectively . this growth in it key driver combine with the significant improvement in it revenue capture rate lead to a 51 % at year - over - year increase in net revenue as it have discus over the past several quarter the roll out of restaurant drive pricing on the Seamless platform in the second quarter of 2014 drive a meaningful increase in the average commission rate than restaurant pay it begin in the second quarter of last year it see some incremental improvement from this change in the third quarter of last year , but more typical fluctuation since . it be still see some impact from this change in pricing in the year - over - year comp . much of this impact will go away next quarter as it lap the anniversary of the change with it largely go away in the third quarter . during the first quarter of 2015 it have one additional factor drive it capture rate higher . the revenue capture rate of the two company it acquire be significantly high than GrubHub and Seamless capture rate because it be provide delivery service din and in restaurant in a one generate extra revenue from restaurant and diner to pay for the cost of the delivery . in total it revenue capture rate for meal that it deliver be roughly double the rate it obtain from meal that restaurant deliver for it . this additional revenue be offset by high operation and support expense which include driver cost . if it exclude the impact of the two acquisition , the capture rate would have be approximately 14.6 % , which be slightly high than the fourth quarter and roughly the same as the third quarter of last year . for the second quarter of this year , it expect the capture rate to rise another 15 basis point to 25 basis point due to the full quarter impact of the two acquisition . after the increase next quarter , it expect the capture rate to return to small natural fluctuation both up and down on a quarter - to - quarter basis . it expect the long - term multi - year trend to be high , but in the short to medium term increase in individual market will be offset by disproportion growth in new market where capture rate be low . as it delivery effort grow overtime , it may start to see some positive impact on rate as well , but it will be offset by incremental operation and support expense . first quarter revenue be 88.2 million , 51 % growth from the year ago quarter or 58.6 million and 20 % growth from the fourth quarter . if it exclude the two acquisition , revenue growth would have be approximately 45 % and 16 % respectively . turn to expense , total sale and marketing expense be 24.1 million this quarter , a 50 % increase compare to the 16.1 million in the same quarter last year . as it say in the last call , it increase it level of advertising the first quarter from the fourth quarter due to growth in seasonality basically spend more in favorable market condition to attract new diner and get current diner to order more . as a result , it attract nearly 500,000 new diner to the platform , exclude the acquisition impact and generate record [ indiscernible ] of close to 235,000 . as it two sided network grow , it can deploy more advertising dollar effectively and accordingly it will be spend more in marketing , especially later in the year . that say for the second quarter , it do expect sale and marketing to dip about 10 % from the first quarter level be of seasonally slow demand . operation and support expense be 22.7 million , a 50 % increase compare to 15.1 million for the first quarter of last year . as a reminder , this line item have historically be comprise a credit card processing , customer care cost , menu operation and as generally scale with volume . as a result to the acquisition , this line item now also include a significant amount of delivery expense exclude the impact from the acquisition growth in operation and support would have be very close to the growth in gross food sale . next quarter the operation that support expense impact from the acquisition will increase due to have a result incorporate for a full quarter . in addition , Matt talk earlier about the compelling opportunity it have in delivery . in order to help it take advantage of this opportunity , it be plan to increase it driver capacity across it network . as a result , it be expect outsize growth with operation and support expense relative to revenue throughout the remainder of 2015 . technology expense exclude amortization of web development be 7.7 million for the quarter , increase 43 % from first quarter of last year and 6 % from last quarter . it continue to hire good engineer and product expert to help with diner facing and restaurant facing product . depreciation and amortization be 6.2 million for the quarter , an increase of 8 % from the fourth quarter of 2014 mostly due to the amortization of intangible asset from the recent acquisition . it expect the baseline go forward to be slightly high since acquisition close mid - quarter . g&a cost be 1.9 million , an increase of 9 % from the first quarter last year and 26 % from the fourth quarter . increase from the fourth quarter be mostly drive by an abnormally low fourth quarter run rate which it talk about in the last call . go forward it expect the run rate to be roughly 1.5 million high than it be this quarter , once it pull in a fourth quarter G&A for DiningIn and restaurant on the Run and other expense relate to it investment in delivery . adjusted EBITDA for the quarter be 28.3 million , an increase of 72 % from 16.4 million in the same quarter the prior year . it adjusted EBITDA margin be 32 % this quarter . net income be 10.6 million compare to the prior year of 4.4 million . net income per fully diluted common share be $ 0.12 on approximately 85.1 million weighted average fully diluted share . it believe the fully diluted share outstanding will be around 86 million for the remainder of the year . as a result of this implication of it tax structure as discuss on last quarter â€™s call , it have an effective tax rate of 42.6 % in the first quarter 2015 . this be more than 300 basis point better than it wait in 2014 and should be a good estimate of it tax rate on a go forward basis . the end of the first quarter be close to $ 300 million in cash in short - term investment . in term of forward guidance it be estimate total revenue for the second quarter of 2015 to be approximately $ 83.5 million and to $ 85.5 million . for the full year , it be revise it revenue guidance range up to 346 million to 361 million . for the second quarter in particular , the forecast assume that the more mild season of weather it have see in April continue for the rest of the quarter . in term of profit , it current expect second quarter adjust EBITDA to be approximately 23 million to 25 million . for the full year , it be keep it adjusted EBITDA range at 101 million to 109 million . it adjusted EBITDA forecast include the high level investment to scale it delivery operation that both Matt and it have talk about . with that , it will turn it over to the operator to take question . question - and - answer session [ Operator Instructions ] it first question come from the line of Dean Prissman with Morgan Stanley . it line be open . so Adam it beat the high end of it EBITDA guidance by 9 % but reiterate it previous full year guidance , just to clarify be there an incremental investment all relate to increase driver capacity ? and then any color on what level of utilization of this capacity it be assume ?  it . in term of the investment as it mention in it remark it be the incremental investment be all relate to delivery , so it be both driver and also technology to support delivery and basically what be happen there be be just invest ahead of the demand and it need to get the scale to be at an efficient level . so , it be that be why it be see the margin go down for the rest of the year than in term of the utilization what it say be obviously it be not go to be an utilization standpoint for the next 6 to 12 month it mean if it probably want to see and optimal utilization stand point from next year which be why it see the margin decrease during this year . got it and then just a quick follow up at a high level can it update it where it be in term of integrate the GrubHub and see these business as from a technology standpoint and what it goal be over the next few year ? sure . this be Matt , let it say in term of the business that be pretty much complete in term of technology there be some -- a very small amount of work to be do , but it be aggressively execute that and it predict it will be do this year . it next question come from the line of Kenneth Dorel with Citigroup . it line be open . Unidentified Analyst hi .  guy , it â€™ Mark [ indiscernible ] , another question when it come to delivery . in term of service that segment of the market that do not have it own delivery network do it see Grub primarily utilize kind of it own delivery infrastructure if it will or be there an opportunity for it to partner with other company that have be under press part of that recently to kind of partner with it to leverage it investment . and then wonder if it could comments sorry it dial in a little late , but comment around the dynamic between kind of with the growth rate look like in the [ pace ] of growth and some of it top more establish market like New York city and Chicago versus some of the new and emerge market ?  . hi , Mark . this be Matt . it will take the first part . it would say that other than [ DRSS ] no one really have scale and deliver from multiple location to multiple recipient on demand and under an hour . so it be definitely open to partner but deep integration be the key here , it have to be align in keep the experience world class and the cost to diner as low as possible so acquire the two lead domestic [ rdss ] to accelerate it logistical capability and each of these company be operate as scale in this industry , so for the mean time it need to be do it it in order to do it right and so that be why it be see the investment over the remainder of this year to execute and find -- get it up to more efficiency . Mark , it â€™ Adam . in term of the growth rate between the different market it think the store be pretty much the same as it have be in prior quarter it mean there be clearly the more developed market be grow at a slow pace than the new market . overall , the large or more developed market be still drive a lot of the growth for the whole company because of it size , it be just that with a lot of large number it be hard to catch up for the small market . but as Matt mention in it comment , it do not know if it be on for it , but market like Denver , Baltimore and Miami , Atlanta , Phoenix kind of right where if not ahead of where tier 1 market for it like L.A. three year ago and base on it behavior today it do not see any reason why it can not be where L.A. be now in a few year . Unidentified Analyst what have it learn in term of how the more established market be trend and the new market in term of the profitability of these market because it have see other company and other country put out pretty high margin and some of these more established market maybe change it view at all in term of how it see the long term margin of the business . well it think it have talk about in the past , it mean back only a year ago when it do a road show it talk about long term margin as be 35 % plus , it mean adjust EBITDA but the reality be that assume that it still have a lot of room to invest for growth right if it be it think it have say in the past too that if -- all it be try to do be maximize cash flow that the margin would be significantly high and it do not think that be change it mean the two thing that happen in every market and be worth mention include that kind of tier 2 market like Denver , Miami , Baltimore so it do see commission rate go up over time and there be more competition in those market it drive the rate that the restaurant be pay high . so that be obviously all incremental margin for it , in addition as diner become more valuable over time because the network be more robust and so diner have less of the reason to not or to order off the network and so it see frequency go up in market overtime as well . so both of those drive the incremental or drive the overall margin of the market higher . it think on a fully load basis it think it margin be very competitive especially in New York and Chicago , but it be also very profitable in those other Tier 2 market as well . it next question come from the line of Nat Schindler with Bank of America . it line be open . a couple of thing just first question on the average daily Grub , the deceleration there be strong than it be in any of the other metric and as continue to be for the last several quarter particularly food sale . do this indicate -- be it a good way to think of this as more of it growth come outside of New York City where it average order size be small but it be frequently as high ? and secondly , have it see any impact from YELP / E24 kind of merge together and push it product a little bit more in market where there be more highly penetrate , particularly it be think San Francisco ? in term of the DAGS it mean really what it be talk about be the law of big number , it â€™ just -- in term of the nominal DAGS it be add just as many DAGS as it be before , it be just on a much big base . it be -- to it point , it be clearly add more dag in non - New York and also non - corporate and it talk about that in the past and that kind of effect the activity rate which it may or may not have be allude to . so good growth , when it look at the cohort in any individual market or in any individual year or time , it be all increase overtime it be just that there be a mix shift . Nat , it be go to take the second part . so nothing have change from it view before versus after that specific deal and the two have it partnership over a year before the acquisition it be fully integrate during that time . it have not see anything specific and it growth continue to be very robust especially in the market where it maybe more penetrate . so in fact some of it secondary market be develop more quickly than the first market . and it think when it look at a broad competitive set especially those it be do exactly what it be try to do nobody be do what it be do at it scale , connect the 35,000 restaurant with over 5.5 million hungry diner . and it remain focus on manage hundred of thousand of order a day and take a very deep approach to manage each one . so hand holding be sometimes very complicated with these highly unique transaction and it hundred of customer care agent be interface daily with both restaurant and diner . so it believe that give it scale it be provide restaurant and diner with unparalleled value . and really nothing have change , for it question . and just one more quick competitive question , have it notice -- it know it have not own it for very long , but any change in the dynamic of hire driver or get driver to do delivery . now that Uber be come in heavily with -- take people with available time to drive people around and now well at least in the small amount do it for food . have that affect it ability to get people ? not at all and in fact that example and all other option like it be actually really similar just another restaurant offering on GrubHub and it have over 35,000 option . so it really have not see any impact in it ability to drive order to restaurant or hire driver . [ Operator Instructions ] it next question come from the line of Aaron Kessler with Raymond James . it line be open . couple of question , first on the weather impact obviously one side bad weather can help it but then also if it have some disruption , it guess net - net it think that be impact Q1 ? second any update on kind of mobile percentage of order in the quarter and finally just on the -- it guess there be an article within the quarter about the Seamless quality of review , any thought on that ?  it . it be Adam , it will take the first two and then Matt will take the article question . in term of weather , it would say net - net be probably mostly flattish if not slightly -- probably slightly bad for it this year than it be last year it think the condition overall last year , it have a very sustain cold winter and [ hurricane ] mostly in February , January be not that bad and then the one thing in January that happen be Juno , which be a negative for it since basically New York be shut down for a day and a half and Boston be shut down for multiple day . so on balance maybe work against just little bit this year , but not a ton . in term of mobile this quarter it do about 53 % of it order be conduct on mobile , it would just expect that to continue to continue to increase . it mean it â€™ go up pretty much every quarter a little bit and it expect more and more people to so order use it phone . the article be unfortunate the Seamless technology be multiple screen to make sure that fraudulent order be not able to -- or fraudulent review be not able to get through . and a few restaurant do figure out a way around that . it be actively manage , it have always be actively manage the review stream and it be in -- it be already fix it to try to resolve it before that article come out , but since then it definitely remove all those article . but in general it have the much great focus on the discovery for diner where it want to make sure it review be accurate more importantly the quantitative datum that underlie all of it transactional information it want to surface that in a way that direct diner to the it next favorite meal like it be say on the call , it think that qualitative information be great and provide context but quantitative datum really show it what it neighbor love and order frequently and it think that be really where the future of discovery be go to be . it next question come from the line of Ralph Schackart with William Blair . it line be open . Ralph Schackart two question if it could . first on the additional the new CMO and sort of the discussion about increase marketing spend , any color it could add just in term of any change in philosophy on the marketing spend go forward and maybe what it should look for ? and then second just in term of the Tam expansion remark today how much of that Tam expansion be from add the fast food -- it be sorry the restaurant delivery versus some inter quarter of fast food restaurant talk about it and then some rumbling about it change look at GrubHub as pay - per - performance and perhaps sort of local marketing spend from the franchiser ?  . sure . Ralph . add Barbara be a huge win for it , it be incredibly intelligent and experienced and it have the long history of product marketing . so it think that when it talk about potential new direction and philosophy classically it have be very good at transactional and advertising . it think in the future it will see a much deep integration of product marketing in drive new way of think and present it product . so for the Tam expansion it would say that , when it be talk that be specifically to the delivery the 70 billion that it have always be point to and be still there and it be aggressively pursue be really the restaurant that deliver for it and all the innovation the excitement it see in it space book inside the GrubHub and outside be really about focus on those restaurant that do not do delivery . and so it look at that set as a new opportunity for diner to either order from more well restaurant or more frequently from the same and so it think there be just a lot of opportunity there . it do not know what it be , but it know that be go to increase the 70 billion and with chain it have always say that the 70 billion be independent restaurant that deliver for it . so by introduce another facet of growth through chain , it think that be even more interesting and even more accelerate to the Tam and that be exactly why it be invest so aggressively for the rest of the year . it next question come from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs . it line be now open . great . it realize it be early on this but can it give it a sense in the market where it have be test and now through the acquisition do delivery , be it see any difference in average daily spend or order size from offer that functionality than -- be that early learn what be drive it to deeper it investment in delivery versus some of the competitive stuff that â€™ go on out there ? and then to the extent that it make these investment in marketing or more direct investment in marketing be it fair to say that be a function of see a positive ROI on the marketing that it be do already versus something where it be try to stem the slowdown in growth . in term of the delivery , why it be think about invest and what it see . what it see unanimously wherever it go be the diner respond to low delivery cost and there be more demand for option that have a low delivery cost and there be more demand in general from more restaurant . so with those to be in the back drop invest in delivery help it attack on both front . because one it allow it to put restaurant on a platform that be not on there before . and then two the more scale that it have , the more efficient that it think will be . which have be the original hypothesis and eventually drive down delivery cost for the diner . it think it be in the good position to do that . in term of the marketing it do not think -- it be not plan on spend any more than it be plan on prior . it have generally top to that increase it marketing spend overtime , the audience be get big a folk that be order online and so there be -- it can spend more effectively across all of it channel . it think it be continue to do some testing across new channel , it talk on the last earning call it do little bit of local Super Bowl advertising which be not plan . but give it the ability to experience that kind of forum and see what kind of reaction it get and it be go to continue to do some experiment . but it be not necessarily -- it would not characterize it be retch up it marketing spend to stem growth . it think it be kind of -- for 2015 it have not really change it plan . it mean just in term of that it mention that a big part of what â€™ important to user be bring down the cost of delivery . give that most of the model that be out there where delivery be pay for , where it â€™ not the restaurant do delivery . how do it see the uptake or the size of the pay delivery part not just it business , but the market because at some level it look at the fact that these pay delivery service have be around for a really long time and have really never get into scale do that at all effect the way that it look at attempt by other company to do pay delivery ? this be Matt , it think that in general if a diner have the option to pay 10 % in $ 10 versus a couple of buck , it be go to always choose the cheap version and that â€™ what it datum be show it in the market where it have be play around experiment with delivery fee . so by charge the entirety of the delivery charge to the diner , it think that enable a pretty fast expansion . but the real long - term opportunity be partner with the restaurant in a deep way because the restaurant be willing to pay the transport if it see more sale and that â€™ it angle and that â€™ why it be leverage it 35,000 restaurant and it integrate tablet that be in restaurant and really try to drive diner fee down because give the opportunity that it be in the same menu and the same restaurant , it be pretty sure everyone be go to choose the cheap version . it next question come from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities . it line be now open . want to ask little bit about new product , it know last year it hire a lot of engineer , headcount go up , cost go up , it want to maybe drill a little bit more on that , what it could expect this year ? it know Matt it have maybe talk about review maybe even splitting bill . and it notice the other day at least it notice it mobile device default to labs grubhub.com UI , wonder if there be anything it can read into that or if it be in the special bucket ?  it . yes , congratulation it be in a special bucket , it do AB testing consistently and it be part of the AB test that it send over the lab just to see how it react to a bunch of it new feature , it be not a massive percentage , but it be like any ab test , it get statistical significant , it be look at a lot of different thing like it say review , it really believe that leverage the quantitative datum behind it transaction of flow be go to be very important to help direct diner to where it be really excited about meet next because if it can show it , it neighbor favorite meal then it be more likely that it be go to come back and order more frequently . so it will see in labs be a part about popular near it and it be start to surface popularity datum further up in the funnel to help people more quickly find what it be look for . it think part of that discovery process be quantitative part of it review , part of it rating and figure all that out . and so look at lab or look at lot of different thing many test fail , but ultimately it be evolve it product base on it diner â€™s appetite as it be and that â€™ really exciting . so it think it can continue to look over at lab if it be wonder where it be go from a diner perspective . and then quick just , very quick follow - up , there have be a lot of noise out there just talk about Google â€™s mobile quality score initiative , anything it want to say on that or any impact ?  . it be Adam , it be prepare for the switch that happen on April 21st kind of well before it and all of it application pass that mobile readiness test and it have be watch the traffic closely , there have be -- it be not -- the process be entirely transparent so it have be watch it kind of for day in case the impact be go to be over a weak instead of over a couple of day and it have have absolutely no impact whatsoever to traffic on any of it device or from a mobile perspective . it next question come from the line of Tom Forte with Brean Capital . it line be open . on the investment and delivery , it want to know if there be way to think about it as far as , be it go to do more investment in it market that be not currently be serve by DiningIn and restaurant on the run and be there be a variance in it investment and delivery spend , for example in Tier 1 versus tier 2 market ? this be Matt . like it say earlier it have already integrate all the restaurant from din in on the GrubHub platform obviously it be push hard in all of the market that be cover by the acquire property . the Restaurants and the Run that be come shortly . but it be look at delivery holistically , obviously the most demand be go to be in the Tier 1 market , where it have the most people in the most restaurant . so it be move very aggressively in those market , both on it own delivery platform as well as expand the RDS which will eventually be integrate from a back end perspective . and then on the Tier 2 it see a ton of green field , tier 2 market be grow exceptionally well for it in the restaurant self - delivery model . it know that it can augment restaurant with it own delivery service it know it can increase the service for diner and it can decrease the fee . so clearly that be where be go next and it be a matter of balance it priority and frankly when it look at the investment that be reflect in it guidance growth EBITDA it really be take into account the fact that it want to grow in all place at the same time because it see so much opportunity right in front of it . it next question come from the line of John Egbert with Stifel . it lien be open .  for take the question . it want to ask it about a density of grubhub order chart that use to have in industry presentation and as it towards to Q4 , 2013 which have about 7 city with a thousand order per day , than another dozen order per day at over 500 and then about over a 100 city that be less than the 500 . Could it tell it at all what that map of the quite today ? be there a lot more of this small city that be now generate 500 order per day ? so , it think the growth in the small market it think be one of the large end part of the story .  . yes . , sure . it think it be talk about the graphic that it have in it s1 , so it mean short answer be ; there be a lot more market right now that be in that 1,000 plus order a day category than it would have see in the s1 and then by extension there be lot more in the 500 hundred plus bucket as well . it think it have -- it try to talk a little bit about it in the call but it be -- kind of the next wave of large city that it have be develop for a short period of time like Denver and Miami and Atlanta and Phoenix all of those would have be Tier 1 market for it just 2.5 year ago . so that be see good growth and in the lot of this small market and feel really good about that $ 70 billion Tam . it next question come from the line of James Cakmak with Monness , Crespi , Hardt . it line be open . hi ,  . so , just go back to the marketing spend it guy have be historically very efficient with it but -- it be go to see it escalate a little bit as it progress through the year , but just want to see the first mover advantage be so important in it emerge market and if it potentially see a company like YELP , now tide up with E24 escalate it spend to get that mine share from those consumer and those grow territory ; would that change it view point on how it be spend . just try to gauge could it potentially see a truly a type of advertising situation if it competition decide to step it up . and then secondly on the it know it be fairly on the acquisition -- delivery acquisition any just industrial learning be either it guess surprise that both positive and negative in the first couple of month .  it . James in term of marketing spend part there be really go to be a material change in this spend philosophy , it be go to be as aggressive as it be plan on the incremental investment it be see be really about the delivery capacity and the logistic team be on the delivery side . so as it be think on marketing spend it agree with it first mover advantage be very strong and that be it have be invest heavily for year and not just the Tier 1 but the Tier 2 , tier 3 and it have the most significant presence in university campus as across the country because it recognize that once it get it brand out and it get the restaurant sign up it be very hard for someone else to come in and take over that two side of network . so it be go to continue to aggressively invest with it national television advertising something no one else be do but it would not characterize it competition as anyone group in particular it be still the paper menu . the majority of people in this country be order from a paper menu and call a restaurant to put order through and that be what be really compete against some more be go to continue to compete against that as aggressively as possible . and it second part of the surprise in the RDS integration it think that there be not it have be really in a surprise because it know this company it have be around for 20 year it have talk at length to the management team and it be pretty much execute integration plan as expect and move forward very aggressively . [ Operator Instructions ] it next question come from the line of Chris Merwin with Barclays . it line be now open . so in term of the restaurant partner that it have in 1q it think that be up by about 2,000 from the fourth quarter , can it talk about how many of the addition be come from restaurant where ire provide the delivery ? and maybe also it can give some color on whether or not there be mostly come from it new market or it core market ? and then just a second question in term of it data asset , it talk about how -- about how it be go to leverage that more maybe increase personalization with the site , do that have any impact on it ability -- with the take rate obviously like the top pay restaurant or the top of the score it introduce personalization , do that have any impact just do not show the standard take rate with restaurant of the high pay at the top of the score or how it guess would it integrate that ?  . in term of the restaurant as it think -- it do not report the number of restaurant on a quarter - by - quarter basis and the reason that it do not be because the quality of the restaurant that it be bring on be a lot more important than the number of restaurant that it be bring on . so it be -- it do not -- at the end of the day the number of restaurant be not go to drive the model , it be the number of diner . all that say , it think it recently increase to what it be say externally from over 30,000 or more than 30,000 to more than 35,000 if it calculate a number of restaurant on the site and get 2,000 incremental . what it would say be that 2,000 how it â€™ diversify -- be definitely in both it tier 1 and it Tier 2s and it Tier 3 . so it have large sale force that â€™ allocate all geography and as it have say before these two side network take time to build and so it need to add restaurant and small market it need to add restaurant and add the diner and add more restaurant and it kind of build on it . so it be actually easy to address in it more develop market . but it be add restaurant actively across all of it market . in term of the delivery versus self - delivery , very few of that several thousand restaurant be restaurant that it be deliver for . but it be in -- it believe it be well over a 100 at least that it add in the last quarter to , but it be a lot small than the number of restaurant that it be add that be self - delivery . it do expect the number of restaurant that it add that it provide the delivery for it to be a lot high throughout the rest of the year . in term of the take rate and the personalization , the way that it be think about be , it mean it take a very say analytical approach , but it really focus on ; at the end of the day kind of what â€™ the good return , right and so there be a combination of personalization and kind of it call it option rate , but restaurant drive pricing dynamic that get it to an optimal revenue number , optimal lifetime value of a diner and that â€™ really what it be try to get to . so it be -- just to get it it be not go to implement a change that â€™ go to cut revenue by 20 % because it surface restaurant that be pay a lot less , it mean it have to take a much more thoughtful holistic approach kind of combine the tow and come up with a way to really maximize the value of the diner . it want to maximize the number of order and it want to maximize the total amount of money that it spend with GrubHub and by extension the amount of money that it generate for GrubHub . it next question come from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer . it line be now open . Jason Helfstein two question , so when it talk about how it make the network more proprietary and it think investor try to compare it market -- it business loss to kind of an open table and by definition if it use open table [ VRB ] , it will likely be only system it use versus restaurant can accept order from multiple source albeit the consumer probably want to just go to one place . so what can it do to effectively make the network as proprietary as possible ? whether it be on the kind of the consumer side or the restaurant side ? and then can it talk about the challenge with delivery kind of be in New York it meet around [ indiscernible ] early on it have really good service , as it be go more popular it service quality have go down dramatically , just talk about kind of how it guy be think about that ?  . so it first question about make a network more proprietary , first of all it do have a proprietary platform -- tablet proprietary in the restaurant . it be somewhere near half of it restaurant , specifically the more high volume restaurant . it be call the OrderHub and it make very -- facilitate order fulfillment , it make it easy and more efficient for restaurant to manage the dramatic order flow it be able to generate in many , many , many market . but it would say , to really answer to it question be , it be the two sided market it . the two sided market grow in value to both participant , the restaurant and the diner as it expand and with the scale it be at right now , a restaurant be crazy not to be on the market in all of it Tier 1 and now more strongly in it Tier 2 as well . because it just it can not afford miss out on those order and from a diner perspective it can look at any option and it be not go to build that as much exclusivity because it be not go to be a valuable as a fact that the offering that it provide on it platform be so much superior to anyone else . so as it grow the two side of market it actually make a network more competitively differentiate as it actually provide more service to it diner and restaurant . and then to it delivery question , it think it nail it , execute at out scale be very - very hard and nobody be execute that it scale , that be why it have hundred of people in it customer service department , that â€™ why it have invest so much over time at execute it -- high quality of volume it be because it be difficult that it be again another proprietary differentiation of GrubHub . so as it build delivery this be why it get people like Girish involve because it can help it think through how do it see real problem at scale in a way that satisfy it restaurant and diner across the country at the multiple hundred of thousand of order a day scale which be something that no one else do . it next question come from the line of Rohit Kulkarni with RBC . it line be open .  it so much for take it question , two please . Can it draw out it assumption underline it be in incremental spend and to expand it RDS footprint in particular what percentage of restaurant do it think on it network would -- it would be able to roll out delivery service by end of this year , for instance . and secondly on diner frequency it have be steadily decline over the last few quarter obviously because it add diner at such a fast clip ; so it question be , be there a point at not so far out in the future as it make a lot of product improvement in term of delivery , in term of the thing that it have in lab and it reach some sort of a critical match Tier 2 city where it probably have add a lot of diner , this trend of diner frequency or repeat usage kind of start change overtime ?  it . hi . rohit . it don complete really understand the first part of the question about the delivery investment can it repeat that ? what percentage of it restaurant do it think it would have it delivery service roll out by end of this year ? the way that it characterize it before be , first of all just to clarify it be mostly focus right now on add new restaurant that don ' t have it delivery service to the network because it that provide a big bank for the with it diner . More restaurant choice what it have find in every market that it have be in , the more restaurant that it add to the network the more valuable the network be for all of the restaurant so a rise Tide kind of list , look all -- it do not cannibalize each other -- actually add more order to the network in total . but in term of how much will be deliver versus self - deliver , it think Matt make comment in it script about how the vast majority of it growth be still go to come from restaurant that be deliver for it and it think that be true . it do 235,000 order day in the first quarter that number will probably be high in the fourth quarter of this year but a very - very small fraction to that will be certainly less than 10 % probably less than 5 % of that will be deliver by it by the end of the year it just take time for it to ramp up . in term of the frequency and where it â€™ go , it think it â€™ somewhat the dynamic that it mention in term of add a lot of new diner that have not mature to the system but it â€™ also really drive by the mix shift , legacy -- substantial portion of it diner or food sale be generally do by corporate customer in New York and as it diversify away from those two -- really the corporate customer have the big impact on the activity . it be a great business for it but it be very difficult to grow that business more than 10 % a year . but those diner be extremely active and as it add more non corporate diner to a less extent non New York diner , it see that activity rate go down . but as it mention earlier when it look at cohort of diner , so if it look at it 2012 cohort or 2013 cohort or 2014 cohort , the activity rate in all of those cohort be go up over time . so presumably at some point it do get to a point where the mix impact be offset by the improvement in activity but it have not do that calculation . it next question come from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Company . it lien be open . just a quick one . in city like let it say , San Francisco it have a lot of company offer delivery service , be it see any trend away from restaurant provide it own delivery personal ?  . it be still see the restaurant provide delivery for it . at the end of the day that -- it be not see it , it be not see it restaurant , at least on it network kind of say , hey , in any great number than it have . it mean historically restaurant have outsource to RDS ; but it have not see that shift dramatically towards outsource versus in - sourcing . it next question come from the line of Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee . it line be open . first one be , can it quantify how much investment it be actually go to make this year on delivery service and how do that scale next year ? and then a clarification on the chain restaurant , be it say that it be have active discussion with these chain right now and if it be wonder what kind of response it have see if any in what sort of factor be important for it ? of course it scale , be it cost or be something else , what be it push back on ? and it think those two . in term of how much investment that it be make to diner , it be sorry then on the delivery side , what it would say be just look to -- it look at the operation and support line item and it strip out , look the RDS â€™ be do and anything incremental be go to be it investment there . in term of quantification , it think it be go to be roughly plus or minus 10 million for the year that it would not have spend if it be not invest aggressively in delivery . but that â€™ plus or minus , that could scale up a little bit or scale down a little bit . in term of chain it be definitely have conversation with chain , it think GrubHub at it scale right now change of variance be just be not increase there , it sale and it be very logical way to do that . the conversation really revolve as be it expect around cost quality and integration . Chain be very aware of the quality perspective , the brand , perception and it want to make sure that whoever it be partner with be deliver on the product with the promise of high quality at low cost for it diner and integration be part of that . and so it think that as it watch it in the future make deal , it be go to see a very high quality expectation because GrubHub have the ability to fulfill that . and this be Adam before it move on to next question , it just want to come back to the investment question once again , just to clarify . so there be additional incremental revenue associate with the delivery business . so the restaurant be actually pay some of the freight and delivery fee to the diner that come to GrubHub . so overtime that spend that it be make will be offset by revenue , it just that this year it be spend little bit ahead to build the infrastructure . but overtime there will be revenue from both the restaurant and the diner to offset the cost of delivery .
