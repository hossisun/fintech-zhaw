 , Roger and  to everyone . let it first start with a summary of it 2015 first quarter financial performance in comparison to last year . sale total $ 1.608 billion in the quarter , $ 80 million low than the last year reflect the impact of currency due to the strong U.S. dollar as well as the divesture of it Venezuela operation , which it complete in January of this year . these two factor alone lower sale in the quarter by about $ 148 million and adjust for these item , sale increase in the quarter by $ 68 million or an increase of 4 % compare with last year , drive by improved market demand in certain segment , new business , and pricing and recovery . adjusted EBITDA for the quarter total $ 176 million , $ 11 million high than last year and provide a margin of 10.9 % , which be a 110 basis point improvement compare with last year . favorable conversion on increase volume and mix and net favorable performance be key factor drive the strong result in the quarter . net income total $ 63 million compare with $ 34 million a year ago , drive mostly by high adjust EBITDA and low amortization , restructuring , and income tax expense . net income in the quarter also include a net charge of about $ 4 million for previously report non - controlling interest income and an offset gain from the completion of the sale of it joint venture in Venezuela . Diluted adjust EPS increase 56 % to $ 0.50 per share compare with $ 0.32 a year ago , reflect high adjust net income in the quarter as well as a low share count relate to the continue execution of it share repurchase program . free cash flow be a use in the quarter of $ 82 million , largely a result of seasonal working capital requirement and $ 46 million high than last year , principally reflect the receipt of $ 40 million of accrue interest in the first quarter of 2014 upon the sale of an outstanding note receivable . now let it go into some further detail in discussion of it first quarter result start with sale and adjusted EBITDA comparison as highlight on slide 12 . it be go to spend a little time on this slide which provide a sale and ebitda comparison for the first quarter of 2015 as well as the key driver of the year - over - year change . so , let it first review the regional distribution of sale in the first quarter compare with a year ago . on the upper left of this slide , it will note a significant change in it regional sale this quarter as it South America result be low 21 % compare with last year , reflect the divestiture of it Venezuela operation , low light and commercial vehicle demand , and unfavorable currency . North America sale increase to 52 % of sale as demand be high for both light and commercial vehicle in the region while Europe as a percent of sale fall slightly to 29 % , principally reflect the result of unfavorable currency of about $ 87 million . adjust for the effect of currency , it experience increase demand in the region of about $ 17 million as all but it Off - Highway group have volume gain . South America represent about 7 % of sale compare to 12 % last year as sale fall about $ 92 million . currency in the Venezuela divestiture lower sale by $ 20 million and $ 27 million respectively with low end market demand , primarily in the commercial vehicle front account for the remain $ 45 million reduction . Asia - Pacific be up slightly from a year ago drive by increase demand across all of it business segment and a relatively stable currency environment . the chart from the bottom left provide the key driver of the $ 80 million sale change in the quarter . as highlight , currency be the main driver , lower sale by $ 121 million or 7 % drive mostly by the strength of the U.S. dollar against many currency , but most notably the euro and Brazil real , which account for about $ 90 million plus of the change . the divestiture of it venezuelan operation reduce sale by $ 27 million , and on a full - year basis will represent about $ 110 million in sale reduction in it light vehicle driveline business segment . volume and pricing drive sale $ 68 million high than last year or about 4 % as it see the expect increase demand in the light and commercial vehicle market in North America as well as new business roll on that overcame headwind in both Brazil and the off - highway equipment market . while sale be low in the quarter by $ 80 million , adjust EBITDA increase by $ 11 million to $ 176 million in the first quarter , with margin improve 110 basis point to 10.9 % . and the chart to the bottom right provide the key driver of the increase in adjust EBITDA for the quarter . so , currency lower adjust EBITDA by about $ 25 million , which do include transaction gain of about $ 6 million in last year 's result which do not recur . the remain $ 19 million principally reflect the impact of translation of about 16 % , which be in line with the guidance it provide in February . it can note factor offset currency total $ 36 million in the quarter , drive an improvement in both absolute adjust EBITDA as well as margin performance , and include the year - over - year impact of Venezuela , favorable conversion on high volume and mix , and positive net performance reflect continue progress in it net cost efficiency and productivity around the world . on the next two slide , it will walk through the sale and segment EBITDA performance for each of it business segment , start with light vehicle Driveline and commercial vehicle Driveline on slide 13 . light vehicle Driveline post sale of $ 637 million in the quarter , an increase of $ 19 million compare with last year . as highlight here , currency lower sale by $ 17 million with the euro and South America currencie represent the majority of the impact and the divestiture of it Venezuela operation , which account for $ 27 million of the change . adjust for these two item , sale rise by nearly 11 % compare with last year with volume and mix , provide an increase of $ 56 million , reflect continued strength in North America and some improvement in Europe as well as new business . pricing and recovery further increase sale by about $ 7 million , largely reflect inflation recovery in South America . segment EBITDA be $ 34 million this quarter , improve by $ 4 million compare to last year . the divestiture of Venezuela improve the comparison by about $ 18 million . volume and mix contribute $ 11 million and increase EBITDA with net performance provide an additional $ 6 million in increase earning . segment EBITDA margin of 10 % improve by 510 basis point compare with last year . and even adjust for the impact of the Venezuela divestiture , margin still rise by almost 200 basis point in the current quarter . let it move to commercial vehicle Driveline . sale total $ 433 million in the quarter , $ 24 million low than last year . as highlight here as well , currency lower sale by about $ 30 million with a weak Brazil real and euro account for most of the impact . on the volume mix front , significantly weak demand in South America provide a $ 43 million headwind which be mostly offset by a strong north american demand environment , and finally price and recovery increase sale by about $ 7 million in the quarter . segment EBITDA be $ 35 million for the quarter , or 8.1 % of sale . currency reduce EBITDA by $ 2 million and the decline in South America market demand further impact earning by $ 8 million . rest of world demand increase be principally a strong environment in North America provide a $ 5 million offset . net performance in the fourth quarter be low by $ 4 million compare with last year as it do incur premium cost to meet increased production demand in North America , as it move to completion of it supply chain improvement initiative in the current quarter . now let it review the performance of Off - Highway Driveline and Power Technologies for the quarter . off - highway Driveline sale total $ 284 million for the first quarter , $ 57 million low than last year with the weak euro account for most all of the headwind . volume and mix be down only $ 12 million compare to last year as new business from the north american construction market mute the impact of global ag equipment demand weakness . Off - Highway post segment ebitda of $ 39 million , about $ 3 million less than last year , yet margin improve again by 140 basis point to 13.7 % , and as highlight here , currency be the main driver , lower earning by about $ 10 million compare to last year with strong performance from material saving and cost efficiency add $ 90 million to the comparison , temper the impact of currency and as well as the market impact , which further drive the improved margin performance . move to Power Technologies , sale for the quarter be $ 254 million , $ 18 million low than a year ago , and similar Off - Highway , currency be a major driver , lower sale by about $ 28 million , principally reflect a weak euro and canadian dollar . increase light - vehicle demand in both North America and Europe increase sale by $ 10 million or almost 4 % compare with a year ago . segment ebitda of $ 38 million be $ 6 million low than year ago reflect the impact of currency with favorable volume and mix , target increase new product development and engineering . now let it turn to it cash metric for the first quarter , which be highlight on slide 15 . free cash flow be a use of $ 82 million compare to a use of $ 36 million last year . and as highlight here , the principal difference overall relate to a non - recur receipt of about $ 40 million in interest and a note receivable in the first quarter of last year . work capital this quarter be a use of about $ 139 million compare to a use of $ 79 million a year ago largely reflect seasonal movement , high demand of certain end market , and to support it supply chain initiative . cash interest be low $ 19 million in the quarter compare with last year , a result of the unsecured debt refinance it execute in the fourth quarter and the timing of it semiannual interest payment on it current outstanding unsecured note . go forward this year , it net cash interest payment will be about $ 12 million in the second quarter , $ 33 million in the third quarter , and $ 11 million in the fourth quarter . cash taxis be $ 14 million , $ 13 million low than a year ago , largely reflect the timing of it estimate tax payment as well as jurisdictional profitability . capital spending be $ 62 million , slightly low than last year . but it do expect capital spending to increase over the remain course of the year principally drive by light vehicle driveline investment to operationalize new business launch in 2015 as well as 2016 . at the end of the quarter , cash and marketable security total $ 1.05 billion . in addition to free cash flow for the quarter , it execute $ 63 million in share repurchase as Roger highlight and complete the redemption of it remain 2019 unsecured note for about $ 55 million . lastly , currency lower cash balance by about $ 53 million in the quarter compare to it year - end 2014 balance . outstanding debt be $ 1.625 billion at the end of the quarter and result in net debt position of about $ 575 million . and finally , total liquidity stand at $ 1.414 billion at the end of March of this year , include $ 384 million of availability under it U.S. credit facility . now let it move to it full year 2015 financial target which be highlight on page 16 . as it experience in the first quarter , it certainly expect currency movement to further impact sale for the remainder of the year , in particular it expectation of further weakening of the euro and the Brazil real compare to it previous expectation . it full year 2015 sale guidance now reflect the euro at $ 1.05/€ compare to it previous expectation of $ 1.1/€ and the Brazil real at BRL 3/$ compare to it previous expectation of BRL 2.5/$. the translation impact of these currency change result in Dana 's full year expect sale now to be in the range of $ 6.3 billion to $ 6.4 billion compare to it prior range of $ 6.4 billion to $ 6.5 billion . as highlight here , it be tighten it adjusted EBITDA range to $ 740 million to $ 750 million and increase it margin target to about 11.7 % for the full year . despite the impact of currency translation on it expect full year result , it be able to maintain it adjust EBITDA and improve it margin as improve market mix and it cost performance temper the impact of translation . and while it expect the low demand environment in South America to continue largely impact it commercial vehicle driveline business , it be see an increase in light commercial vehicle demand in North America and Europe that be provide an offset . it dilute adjust EPS guidance of $ 2.05 to $ 2.15 per share , capital spending of $ 300 million to $ 320 million , and it free cash flow target range of $ 190 million to $ 220 million remain unchanged . so this conclude it presentation and it will now turn the call over to the operator for any question .  it . question - and - answer session [ Operator Instruction ] it first question come from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc . please go ahead with it question . Roger J. Wood - President , Chief Executive Officer & Director Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets , Inc.  , gentleman . Craig Barber - Director - Investor Relations William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets , Inc. two quick question here . first of all just from a clarification standpoint , slide 13 , the volume and mix in the Brazil market , what be the difference between those two ? William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President oh , yes . it be sorry Brett , this be Bill . what it have highlight on – it be speak to commercial Vehicle Driveline obviously , on the bridge , correct . Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets , Inc. William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President if it look at the volume mix , it be basically rest of world demand , but most notably North America , so it separate the two to highlight what be go on in North America vis - à - vis what it be see in the Brazil market currently . so it be to separate the two and it will note here about the net impact be a slight margin – or a slight sale undercall if it will of $ 1 million , but certainly , different region be contribute to that change in sale , so it want to highlight that for the audience . Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets , Inc. okay . and Brazil , so the Brazil market be simply volume mix . it be not necessarily incorporate currency or anything along those line ? William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President correct , the currency line as highlight here , Brett , the $ 30 million , that be all currency impact with respect to operation around the world for commercial vehicle . Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets , Inc. okay . perfect . and then with regard to again slide 13 , so 10 % margin in the Light vehicle Driveline , 8.1 % margin in the commercial Vehicle Driveline , obviously below it corporate average margin and kind of it long term margin expectation . Can it kind of talk about as it look through the next year or two , how do it think about margin progression in each of those two segment ? what may that look like ? and what may be some of the key driver of margin improvement in those segment ? William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President sure , sure , Brett . it be Bill . it will take a stab at this and certainly Roger or Mark will jump in as well . let it talk a bit about light vehicle Driveline . it think it can see the performance here in the quarter at 10 % margin , a very good performance . and as it move forward , as it have speak to many of it in the past , it certainly expect light vehicle Driveline to contribute to it overall exit target margin that it have talk about with respect to , it would say , near term performance 2016 and post . so it be certainly on the path there . the driver of that margin performance it think continue , one , to be the cost efficiency be drive in the business , but probably most notably be the net business that be come on line from a sale backlog perspective . and it think to some extent it be see that impact already in it first quarter on the volume mix line which be a contribution margin of about 20 % in light vehicle Driveline . so certainly it expect light vehicle Driveline to contribute to it overall margin move forward in the coming , it would say , medium term . on the Commercial Vehicle front , and it will let Mark talk a bit to this as well , from it perspective though obviously go through from a margin perspective the impact of the supply chain initiative that it embark upon last year and have just have complete , if it will , with respect to execution . that certainly have be somewhat of a headwind to it , but by default , it turn into a tailwind and probably most notably , it provide it additional flexibility and competitiveness move forward . so certainly , it would expect that margin to move up as it move into the intermediate term . it be certainly dependent on what happen from a demand perspective , but an 8 % margin certainly be not it expectation for the business and quite frankly by year - end of 2015 it expectation would still remain at about a 10 % margin for the business with opportunity move forward . Mark Wallace - Executive Vice President and Group President , On - highway Driveline Technologies yeah , and Brett , Mark Wallace . on the commercial Vehicle business with it supply chain initiative , again as Bill mention , it be about capacity , flexibility , and competitiveness , and if it kind of exclude it premium cost that it have be incur to fill the pipeline at these elevated market level , it be definitely see a contribution margin improvement already in it north american business . it definitely would need some help from Brazil . as it can see very low level , it be back at 10-year ago level , at 2004 and 2005 level . so definitely it would like to see some improvement in the revenue in Brazil , that would be definitely be part of it exit rate in 2016 . and back over to the Light vehicle Driveline , as Bill mention , it have new program that be come on and as it have commit , it be come on at well margin than it run rate have show in the past . and as it have also articulate , it have new business launch later this year and into 2016 that will definitely be support it 2016 exit rate . so it be positive on both of these business drive it exit rate in 2016 . Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets , Inc.  it , gentleman . it next question come from the line of Patrick Nolan with Deutsche Bank . please go ahead with it question . Patrick E. Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities , Inc.  , everyone . Roger J. Wood - President , Chief Executive Officer & Director William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President  , Pat . Patrick E. Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities , Inc. just a couple of question . it want to follow up on the last one about the commercial vehicle driveline business . Mark , how be it think about – it mean next year it be probably look at probably a well market in South America , but there could be some headwind in North America . it know today the decremental in South America be bad than the incremental it be see in North America . so in North America , it be get even before these startup cost , it be seem like it be close to a 10 % incremental and Brazil , it seem like it be almost twice that on the downside . when it flip - flop and Brazil start go up , be it go to get the same type of incremental and Brazil be go to be twice that of the decrement it will see in North America or – and that be why it can offset the North America headwind ? be it think about it right in that context ? Mark Wallace - Executive Vice President and Group President , On - highway Driveline Technologies yes . it think on the Brazil market , it mean clearly with the volume at the level it be at , it mean it have get closer and closer and closer to it breakeven point . although , it be still profitable in Brazil , it be definitely – the decremental be flow through at a high rate than it would typically see at a normal market . so it think as volume get back to Brazil at a close rate , it will be back to the normal incremental level . however , in North America , even if it see some volume subside , it do expect margin improvement in it north american business due to it supply chain initiative as it mention , so it should see overall margin improvement in 2016 move forward . Patrick E. Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities , Inc. got it . and if it could switch gear a little bit to the Off - highway business , it look like it be actually track ahead of it plan for margin for 2015 in that business . it think it be guide to around 13 % . it be at 13.% in Q1 , but it question be , it be do really strong margin in that Off- highway business , arguably at the trough of the cycle . how do it think about what the long term potential of that business be as margin have improve ? it mean can this be a mid double - digit EBITDA margin business or even higher go forward ? Roger J. Wood - President , Chief Executive Officer & Director yeah . so this be Roger . the Off - Highway group have do a really nice job even in light of the very , very difficult market condition around the world in that segment , but as it recall maybe three or four year ago , it separate that group out to be run independently with a separate management team just like the rest of the business unit , so that it could focus it energy and effort on just that market and just that business , take advantage of the global strength synergy that it have across the four different business unit that it have , but thus face that market for the customer and so forth . by do that , it be able to very quickly over the last two to three year make some tremendous efficiency gain in what it be do , because it be not kind of embed in another business unit , if it will . it be out there on it own and it have do a really nice job with that . in addition to that , by focus on the customer and utilize the technology that it have throughout the organization across the four business unit , have be able to apply specific technology to specific application and those be now come on board in light of the trough of the market . so it be not just ride the trough of the market , it be also be able to penetrate a little bit some new customer with new technology and just exactly what Mark have just mention about CV and LV , the new technology come on board with expand margin from the old product that it be ship . so , the combination of all that be allow that group to do very well at the low part of the trough in the market . and it have say many , many time before , one of the thing that it be really excited about with that business be because it have be able to get the business in the position that be it in , similar to the other business , when this market turn up , it can take advantage of the increase volume if it will with the efficiency that it now have in place . in term of the last part of it question of where this could ultimately go , ultimately , it think that there be room for improvement in the business but as it have mention for the overall aggregate of Dana . when it get into the 13 % to 14 % range that do not mean that it could not make those margin go higher because it certainly could , but it focus be really go to be transition over to optimize it growth potential of the business with great margin in the business as oppose to continue to narrow the focus on more and more and more and more profitability with the business that it have . it think that the great way to produce the good shareholder value , and this be few year ago that it come up with this be to get the entire business in the profitability profile that it want it in and then focus on the growth potential that it have in the business . so it have product above that range , certainly , but that range be probably a great range for this business to start optimize the growth potential , and it be really excited about that not only in it highway but the rest of it business as well . Patrick E. Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities , Inc.  very much , it will get back in the queue . it next question come from the line of Justin Long with Stephens . please go ahead with it question . Justin Long - Stephens , Inc.  ,  . William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Justin Long - Stephens , Inc. hey , so first question it want to ask , the divestiture in Venezuela be about an $ 18 million benefit to adjust EBITDA in the quarter , but it be curious if it have any update to the impact that divestiture would have for the full year ? it think last quarter it talk about it be about breakeven in term of the EBITDA impact in 2015 , have that view change at all ? William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Justin , it be Bill . not at all right now , obviously it sale last be about $ 110 million for the business and all of that obviously include it light vehicle driveline business and to it point , it end up in a breakeven position in 2014 on the business . what it will see obviously as quarter roll on here during the course of 2015 , it have get an $ 18 million charge , if it will , a loss if it will on an EBITDA basis a year ago which certainly it avoid give the elegant solution that it execute for the business . about a year ago then it start recovery , right , and mechanism that it be work through , so it be go to get a little volatility in kind of year - over - year basis with respect to kind of the up and down of Venezuela from a quarterly perspective . but from it comment , it be exactly right , annual basis $ 110 million sale reduction for light vehicle Driveline year - over - year with no impact from an EBITDA perspective . Justin Long - Stephens , Inc. okay , great . that be helpful . and secondly , as it think about the multiyear backlog it discuss at the beginning of the year , do it see any potential for the timing of that revenue change at all , whether it be it know the market dynamic it be see today , or product launch change ? just curious if there be any major swing factor on the horizon or if that cadence of revenue over the next couple of year be pretty firm at this point ? Mark Wallace - Executive Vice President and Group President , On - highway Driveline Technologies Justin , it be Mark Wallace . actually it be pretty firm at this point . it be actually see it passenger – it light vehicle driveline business continue to improve in it backlog but it do not see anything else in the rest of the business unit would have any dramatic impact to it . so it be still very optimistic and supportive of what it put out in the backlog and hopefully it have more upside . William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President and Justin , just , it be Bill as well . just probably maybe a little fine touch on it as it progress as well . it know certainly distribution of the business and it be talk about – everyone be talk about FX , right . certainly there will be an impact of FX on the backlog but it think to Mark 's point , what it be see be obviously opportunity that it be execute upon even in the current environment in fact probably be offset , but it will give an update to the market obviously later part of this year , early next year with respect to an update backlog , but to - date very firm . Justin Long - Stephens , Inc. great . that be helpful update . it appreciate the time . Roger J. Wood - President , Chief Executive Officer & Director it next question come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan . please go ahead with it question . Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC hi . this be samik on behalf of Ryan . the first question it have be just to clarify on the revenue guidance . it do take down it revenue guidance by $ 100 million . it be wonder be that entirely just due to currency or be there other move part in term of the underlie market , or for example backlog , be it see any push out on that ? be there any other component of that that it need to keep in mind here just outside currency ? William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President yeah it think if it – excellent question . it know that $ 100 million neck down if it will on the top line be almost 100 % obviously currency and in fact probably a touch higher on the currency level . it be see offset and as part of it margin maintenance , if it will , with respect – or actually improvement in it adjusted ebitda maintenance , opportunity to the upside on end market demand , it think as reflect in it first quarter result as well as what it be see a bit on the new business front and the actual , it would say the actual realization of sale versus what it expectation be at the beginning of the year . so it be exactly right . it think that headwind from a currency perspective , about $ 140 million kind of be offset by about $ 40 million net that it see today with respect to upside on demand as well as new business be launch during the course of the year as well as new business that have already be launch late last year that be operate at a high level than it expectation . so , it be right , it be a little mix of both , but largely FX . Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC so , just to follow up on that , obviously margin , it be raise it margin guidance here and it have mention it ( 40:05 ) come in at well margin rate but be there any raw material benefit here that it be look at ? maybe remind it if there be any outlook for – that it have give for what benefit from raw material do it get during – in 2015 as well ? Mark Wallace - Executive Vice President and Group President , On - highway Driveline Technologies yeah , it be Mark Wallace . just on raw material , basically especially in it Light vehicle and commercial vehicle Driveline business , most of those be pass - through issue with it customer . so , mainly whatever favorability it pick up in the near term will be pass back to the customer and vice versa . so , right now there be really no significant impact for material in 2015 . Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC okay , great . and just it last question here , it mention that utilization level in it north american facility be run quite high and maybe there be some premium cost that it be incur but just think about probably what one of it competitor mention here that it have sort of on the class 8 side that capacity be more at the 320,000 unit level . so what be the sort of capacity it have currently or what level , up to which level will it be able to comfortably support and be it open to put in more capacity if require if the market have more upside here ? Mark Wallace - Executive Vice President and Group President , On - highway Driveline Technologies sure , good question . again it be Mark Wallace ; actually the rate recently have be run around 340,000 unit , so , definitely a strong market . it have actually be put in capacity at it supply network . it assembly plant , it have the capacity and obviously be support the current run rate today and it do expect in the future to be able to support these high rate that it be see today , so it be confident as it move forward into 2015 and beyond that it can support rate at this current run rate it be at today . Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC okay . great ..  for take it question .  it . it next question come from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs . please go ahead with it question . David , please make sure that it line be not on mute . David J. Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. yes ,  , it actually be on mute . Roger J. Wood - President , Chief Executive Officer & Director William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President David J. Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. yeah , rookie mistake over here . piggyback off of that last question , the net performance drag that it see in the first quarter on commercial Vehicle Driveline , be that expect to continue into the second quarter of this year or be that pretty much – and it think it say that it be complete this quarter , but should it see the benefit start to hit the P&L now or be that more second half ? Mark Wallace - Executive Vice President and Group President , On - highway Driveline Technologies yeah , Dave , it be Mark Wallace . a couple of thing , one , it have already – see sequential improvement from Q4-to - Q1 relate to premium . it will also experience some premium cost in Q2 , but it will be actually on the decline basis , so it should see margin progression throughout the rest of the year and as already mention , it should approximate it 10 % EBITDA target it have for full year . David J. Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. okay , that be helpful . and then it guess it be a little bit catch off guard on the Light vehicle Driveline and the Venezuela divestiture . it mean it guy kind have kind of spoken to exactly what it think there , but for the rest of the business , it mean when it strip it out year - over - year and take a look at it , be it fully just the content growth from incremental new business ? be there some additional benefit from mix shift , from small car , medium car and the light truck that be help it kind of at least outperform what it be expect ? Mark Wallace - Executive Vice President and Group President , On - highway Driveline Technologies yeah , Dave , it be Mark Wallace again . when it look at it light vehicle driveline business , it have obviously have strong demand with Jeep and the Ford Super Duty . it have very strong demand with Jaguar Land Rover in England as well as it see a recover market in Thailand . but on top of that , as mention before , it be see the expansion on the Colorado / Canyon hit it full year at better than it expect . so kind of a good news across the board , it be see definitely some improvement in the current base of business , but as well as it new business come on at the well margin rate . David J. Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. understand . that all make sense . and just lastly , the U.S. GAAP tax rate , it think that be move up from 24 % to 31 % , anything there it should be aware of ? William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President yeah , it touch that up a bit . this be Bill . and it be exactly right , it touch it up to about 31 % . and what it will note here be it be see kind some incremental tax expense largely around it U.S. operation . it will recall in the fourth quarter of last year , it release or have a benefit in the income statement of about $ 179 million of it defer tax valuation allowance . and what it be see be under the accounting rule , it now have to book a tax expense at the – basically the U.S. rate even though it have not complete the planning action that it undertake to realize the benefit a year ago . so basically , what it be see be kind of neck up on that tax expense . and as it kind of proceed the rest of the year , as it look also at it valuation allowance and it defer tax asset position , that probably will be a fourth quarter discussion item as well . there be no cash impact to this , obviously , with respect the utilization of the nol . it be just more of the timing of expense recognition via the accounting rule versus what it have expect when it put it guidance out at 23 % . David J. Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. understand . and that be all from it .  again and congrat on the quarter . William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Mark Wallace - Executive Vice President and Group President , On - highway Driveline Technologies it final question come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays . please go ahead with it question . Steven Hempel - Barclays Capital , Inc. hi ,  , team . it be actually Steven Hempel on for Brian Johnson . William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Steven Hempel - Barclays Capital , Inc. just want to touch base on a couple of thing that be inter - related here . relate to new business launch in 2015 , it believe in the q here , it lie out that some of the offset from high market volume and weak currency be be offset by contribution from new business program launch in 2015 . it believe that be likely related to the gm new mid - size truck program , but before , it note that the net backlog be actually firm at this point . so be basically , the net backlog come in from that program high than expect , but be offset by currency , euro , and other program that may – the net backlog may be low or it guess if it could just help it clarify what it actually mean by high contribution from new business program ? William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President yeah . let it take be for first shot , Mark , and it can follow up on this . if it think about the backlog and it have the progression and how it be go to increment 2015 forward , there be an incremental increase of about $ 140 million expect for 2015 as it progress through the year . so it think it be twofold actually . one be that be base on an assumption of production and it use one particular platform be the GM platform that it launch late last year . it have an assumption with respect to demand . so twofold , one be it be certainly meet that assumption if not exceed it , but it think the more important piece of the puzzle as well be , be that it be see the margin that it expect on that business and obviously from a volume perspective , it be see an uptick in it contribution margin . so it be exactly right , it be kind of the good of the good if it will . it be a great program for it , hopefully a great program for GM as it be see . reasonable and good return on that business in excess of it base business and it be right , it be see some upside in the production environment as it head through not only the first quarter , but the rest of the year . Steven Hempel - Barclays Capital , Inc. okay . and be there any offset that be offset that additional , it would assume that should be group in that backlog then or be there a potential upside to that net backlog for 2015 ? William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President it would suggest there be really no offset to that other than outside of FX , right , but from a pure volume perspective , probably in the current year , may be some positive there . Steven Hempel - Barclays Capital , Inc. okay , and then just kind of related question here . it look at volume mix for LVD be roughly 20 % on an incremental margin basis . it assume that be largely relate to the new business that be roll in . Should it expect similar type of kind of incremental margin here for that business move forward through kind of 2016 and 2017 ? it believe historically it have kind of indicate 15%-ish type incremental margin , so just try to gauge what it should be expect as new business start to ramp ? Mark Wallace - Executive Vice President and Group President , On - highway Driveline Technologies Steven , just on the margin for Q1 , definitely the new business be drive the high major portion of the margin , but also it continue to work on it cost improvement initiative inside . so it do expect that the LVD business will continue to have strong margin than historically and will be again part of it margin expansion into 2016 as well . Steven Hempel - Barclays Capital , Inc. okay , great , and then just one quick follow - up housekeeping , be it still expect price recovery to be a $ 75 million to $ 100 million tailwind in 2015 ? William G. Quigley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Steven , this be Bill . no , not at all , because much of that if it think about it , be what it be experience largely in South America , largely around Venezuela . what the expectation be obviously as it discuss in early January pre the disposition be , that be go to be the same situation , certainly with the solution that it come up with Venezuela , that be go to neck down significantly . it would suggest it be go to be more of a normal course inflation recovery that it have around the world with respect to certain country that it operate in , that be kind of well - wear path with the customer . it think the exception a year ago and really two year ago be largely around Venezuela .
