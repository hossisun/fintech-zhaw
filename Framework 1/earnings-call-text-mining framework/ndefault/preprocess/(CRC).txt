We completed our first four quarter as an independent company and are strongly encouraged by results even with the challenging commodity market. As we entered into the downturn, we laid out our 2015 priorities for the business and our focus quickly turned to the balance sheet.

We have to live within our means and bring our capital investments in line with projected cash flow. Our second priority was seek an amendment from our banks to provide us time to work through this period of lower prices. Lastly, we had to right-size our costs for the current operating environment. So how do we do?

Following the spin-off we responded to this rapid price decline by swiftly reducing the capital for the remainder of 2014 and cut our 2015 capital investment program to $440 million. A reduction of about 80% compared to 2014.

We got our drilling rig count from 27 in November down to three rigs that we’re currently operating. We invested $133 million for the quarter, which was below our guidance. We work with our vendor groups to deliver on our credit amendment that provides flexibility through the end of 2016 to implement our deleveraging plan.

Lastly, we also delivered record crude oil in total production as well as cost reductions for the quarter. And we are on detailed discussions with various parties regarding the full suite of deleveraging options available in our broad portfolio. So again not the market I’d have chosen for our first full quarter, but given the hand we were dealt, we could not have been part of CRC’s execution.

What different CRC from our peers is that we manage it technically and operationally diverse world-class resource base with substantial operational and financial flexibility. In addition, our management and operating teams have extensive experience in all phases of the commodity cycle.

We’ve been tested our first two months as a public company by the rapidly declining oil prices. We are confident that our diverse resource space and our dedicated and highly motivated workforce will allow us to meet the challenges brought about by this price environment.

Many have heard me stress protecting our base production and focus on cash margins, which I’ve amplified to our workforce. These are important, because by protecting our base we will be in a strong position to ramp up our activity level by increasing our already deep inventory and maintaining our margins.

We achieved record quarterly crude oil and total production from our 2014 and 2015 capital programs, with our emphasis on lower decline projects. We expect the emphasis on our base production to become more evident as the year progresses. Our focus on cash margins also continues to show progress. We are controlling operating costs and achieving capital efficiencies while maintaining our attention to safety and proactive community outreach efforts.

While we delivered on all aspects of our operations that we control, we dealt with significant commodity price related headwinds during that quarter that impacted our financial results. Mark Smith, our CFO will discuss our financial results in detail shortly.

As I’ve stated before, we’re committed to living within our cash flows. Our asset base provides us the operating flexibility to adjust our capital program rapidly during the course of the year based on market conditions as well as the ability to shift our capital between basins and drive mechanisms to optimize returns throughout the commodity cycle. As I’ll discuss later, we’re also making progress in our efforts to delever our balance sheet.

Our 2015 capital program is entirely focused on higher margin, higher return and low declining crude oil projects. Beginning in 2014 and continuing to 2015, we’re shifting our emphasis to Steam and Waterflood projects that offer our lower decline and risk profile, while providing attractive returns over their economic lives.

The investments we made in 2014 in Steam and Waterflood projects are delivering a positive impact on 2015 production. A result of this shift we believe that in 2015 our overall base production decline will be lower than historical rates and we also expect Elk Hills decline to continue to moderate as our Elk Hills production profile continued its shift from primary to secondary drive mechanisms.

We’ve implemented our value creation index or VCI metrics across all levels of the organization and have received complete buy in and appreciation of the transparency on how the Company is allocating capital. Our simple formula of the PV-10 of the pre-tax cash flows over the present value of the investments over the projects life allows everyone to know and understand the criteria for investment.

Our first quarter production was ahead of our expectations and the guidance we provided. This was primarily the result of a lower decline in our base production and the production sharing effects in our Wilmington field operations.

The main contributors to our production success include our ongoing shift towards lower decline projects that can create sustained long-term value as well as our focus on optimizing base production.

Our personnel across all our operations have contributed to efficiency improvement that are sustaining our base in lowering both operating and capital costs. We expect to increase our 2015 average daily crude oil production above our 2014 level, while keeping average production on a BOE basis essentially flat compared to 2014.

Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect our oil production to be consistent with our record first quarter level, while our production on a BOE basis is expected to decline modestly to a range of between 158,000 to 163,000 BOE per day.

As I have mentioned before our base capital requirement has come down as a result of shift in our capital allocation. We believe this will enable us to keep our total production for the remainder of 2014 -- 2015 nearly flat with a slight gradual decline as the year progresses. If the current price environment persist into 2016, we'd expect to continue to stay within our cash flows as we have indicated before. Our objective would be to maintain our oil production essentially flat, while our total production experiences modest declines.

We have a significant amount of project inventory and flexibility in how we accomplish our goals to our capital allocation process based on the VCI metrics. During the first quarter we also saw the positive impact of our quick indecisive step to curtail cash outflows resulting from our cost-containment efforts.

Production costs in the quarter were $16.20 per barrel which was comparable to the $16.07 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014 and notably lower than the prior year’s first quarter costs of $18.43 per barrel. Our production costs per unit have generally been declining for the past year. We started seeing the benefits of our efforts at all levels of our organization to implement more efficient message to streamline our processes and to work with our suppliers.

The decline in our operating costs resulted in part from lower natural gas prices which significantly lowered the cost of steam generation for our steamflood as well as the cost of electricity for our field operation.

Electricity prices also tend to be lower in California in the fourth and first quarters due to seasonal factors. While we expect modest pressure on our operating costs in the second quarter from higher electricity prices as we enter the high season, we expect to offset some of this price pressure by further improvements in the controllable components of our operating cost structure.

In addition to the low price environment that persisted throughout the first quarter, we experienced several discrete events in California including the effects of the nationwide refinery strike and a fire at a local refinery. We are able to market our effective production during the quarter. These events contributed the widening of differentials in California, further pressuring our realized prices. The strike has recently ended. While we believe the event -- the effects of these events will take a few more months to work through the system, we believe our realization should continue -- begin to improve gradually during the year.

We will continue to be strategic and opportunistic with our hedging program in support of our capital investment plans. We have been reviewing our hedging options late 2015 and into 2016 based on our expectations of the price environment. So far we have placed hedges on almost all of our oil production for the first half of 2015, about two thirds of the oil production in the third quarter and about one third of the oil production in the fourth quarter of this year.

The hedges have been focused mainly on protecting our capital program against further price deterioration. Over time we envision establishing a 12 to 18 months hedging program in a normalized pricing environment.

I’d like to point out also that our oil and natural gas prices gives us a natural hedge as a significant portion of our operating costs are tied to the price of natural gas which is used for steamfloods as well as power. As a Californian company, CRC and our workforce are committed to doing our part to alleviate the effects of the states drought. Through our long-standing investments in water conservation, we already recycled approximately 79% of our produced water in our improved and enhanced oil recovery operations.

In 2014, our operations also provided more than 2 billion gallons of water to local water districts and farms. As a result, we're net water supplier to agriculture, providing more water for irrigation, than the amount of fresh water we purchased for our state wide operations.

We and other operators are working to further reduce our freshwater use and are committed to expanding our roles in net water supplier. We do not currently expect the state to announce water restrictions to impact our level of oil and gas production.

We ended the first quarter with a debt balance of $6.6 billion, as a result of disposition made to our former parent at the spin-off. We expect to exit 2015 excluding the results of potential deleveraging initiatives with a debt level comparable to the end of the first quarter.

In February, we negotiated an amendment to our credit agreement through the end of 2016. The amendment modified certain covenants to take into account the weakness in the price environment. While we believe the modified terms of our credit agreement will enable us to work through the current commodity price cycle, we have been exploring various alternatives to delever our balance sheet and to better align our capital structure for a more modest normalized commodity price environment.

The deleveraging options we’re exploring with flexibility of our resource space may include a combination of asset monetization, joint ventures, and other opportunities. Given the long time horizon and growth potential of our asset base, we are conducting a thoughtful assessment of the various midstream and upstream alternatives to enhance shareholder value not only in the near-term, but for the longer-term.

We are progressing with these deleveraging efforts and are actively engaged with various parties focusing on potential structures, transaction costs, and implications for our portfolio. We expect to make significant progress on these activities and hope to enter into one or more transactions by the end of this year. In addition, should prices improve significantly in the latter half of the year, we’d apply the majority of the incremental cash flow towards debt reduction.

I’ll now turn the call over to Mark to discuss the details of our first quarter results.

Marshall D. Smith

Thanks, Todd. Our first quarter results largely reflect two factors. First, our record levels of production. Second, continued lower energy prices. Our cost control measures helped soften the impact of the low commodity prices and these measures included our reduced capital investments as well as our actions to reduce our production costs.

Our operations team has been excellent in protecting our base productions, while making the adjustments necessary to live within our projected cash flows. Let me summarize and comment on our results.

Notably our levels of production beat our expectations and guidance for the first quarter. Our average oil production hit a record of 108,000 barrels per day. That was 14% higher than last year's first quarter and 3% higher sequentially than the fourth quarter of 2014.

Our operations in San Joaquin basin delivered a year-over-year increase in oil production of 5,000 barrels per day, reflecting our focus on steamfloods. Production for other assets increased by 8,000 barrels per day which includes the effect of lower prices on our Wilmington field production sharing contracts.

NGL production declined slightly from year-ago levels and natural gas production remained unchanged after slight increase in 2014 when our capital investment program was much larger. Total oil and natural gas production averaged record 166,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This record production represents an increase of 12,000 BOE per day or 8% compared with the first quarter of 2014. Sequentially total production in the first quarter of 2015 increased by 1,000 BOE per day compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.

More than offsetting the positive effect of increased production was the continued decline in prices for all of our products. Most of those declines follow the weakness in Brent which was down 49% year-over-year and 28% sequentially. In addition, our realized prices were driven below historical differentials to Brent and part by the refineries as Todd mentioned.

As a result, our realized crude oil prices averaged $46.44 per barrel in the first quarter. This compares with realized crude prices of $102.32 in last year's first quarter, a decline of 55%. In the fourth quarter, we realized $68.54 resulting in a decline of 32% sequentially.

Largely as a result of the refining events, NGL realized prices decreased even more than crude prices in the first quarter following the $21.55 per barrel down from $60.39 per barrel in last year's first quarter, a 64% drop and from $34.41 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014, a sequential decline of 37%.

Realized natural gas prices also decreased $1.94 per Mcf of 41% below last year's first quarter price, a $4.78 per Mcf and $0.29 -- 29% below the $4 per Mcf price we realized in the fourth quarter of last year.

Reflecting the positive effects of our cost containment program, our production costs for the first quarter of 2015 were $242 million or $16.20 per BOE. This reflected a 12% decline from $18.43 per BOE during the prior year period.

First quarter 2015 production costs were lower than fourth quarter 2014 costs of $243 million and relatively flat on a per unit basis. Lower first quarter costs reflected improved well servicing efficiency and lower costs for gas used to generate steam and power, consistent with Todd’s comment the gas access and natural hedge for us.

Taxes other than on income were $55 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared with $52 million in last year’s first quarter and $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. These consist largely of property taxes which regularly reassess the midyear and the costs of greenhouse gas allowances and production taxes.

Reflecting our significantly reduced drilling activity, exploration expense was $17 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared with $31 million in the first quarter of 2014 and $68 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Interest expense during the first quarter was $79 million due to the debt we incurred in connection with the spin-off in the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally, our overall effective tax rate in the first quarter was 41%.

As a result of these factors, we ended the first quarter of 2015 with an adjusted net loss of $97 million or $0.25 per diluted share. This compares with adjusted net income of $223 million or $0.57 per diluted share for last year's first quarter and adjusted net loss of $7 million or $0.02 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2014.

Our net loss was $100 million or $0.26 per diluted share. This compares with net income for last year's first quarter of $223 million or $0.57 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we had a net loss of $2.1 billion or $5.47 per diluted share.

You'll recall that fourth quarter included a $2 billion after tax non-cash property impairment charge to the carrying value of certain of our properties due to low commodity prices.

Current quarter adjusted EBITDAX was $198 million. This was down from $705 million in last year's first quarter and $454 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.

As we described in our last earnings call, we responded aggressively and deliberately to following commodity prices with decisive measures to adjust our capital investments largely by reducing our rig count. Our capital investment for the current quarter was $133 million compared with $475 million in last year's first quarter and $520 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Said differently, we are running 27 drilling rigs in the November of 2014. We were down to six rigs at year-end. In the first quarter we were running only three rigs.

I want to point out that our reduced capital investment of $133 million was relatively in line with our operating cash flow for the first quarter. This excludes approximately $200 million of cash outlays from capital investment projects that we completed in the fourth quarter as well as our year-end exit rate of spending which I discussed in our last earnings call. We expect a modest amount of this effect to continue into the second quarter.

In the last conference call, I spoke to the fact that we were well advanced in our discussions with our banks relative to the credit amendment. Shortly thereafter we executed the final agreement. I’d like to note that I'm very proud of the strong support CRC received from our bank group and how we were able to work together to craft an effective credit amendment. This agreement is a testament to CRC’s large and diverse resource base as well as our prompt response to the price environment.

We are approaching our deleveraging efforts in a consistent fashion with thoughtful consideration of how to delever the balance sheet, while still maximizing the net asset value of our overall portfolio.

In closing, for the quarter you witnessed first hand CRC’s commitment to live within our cash flow and deliver results. We continue to be impressed by the disciplined approach taken by the entire team in order to defend our margins and focus on value creating activities.

We continue to gain greater appreciation of the flexibility and resiliency of our resource base. Our first quarter results demonstrate this resiliency and our focus on costs. Please note that we provided key second quarter 2015 guidance information in the attachments to our earnings release. I'll be happy to take any questions you may have on that information and on other aspects of our results during the Q&A portion of the call.

I’ll now turn it back over to Todd. Todd?

Todd A. Stevens

Thank you, Mark. In closing, we had a successful first quarter 2015, by achieving new records for oil and overall production, continuing to reduce operating costs and improving our capital efficiency in meeting our commitment to operating safely and responsibly.

The price environment presents us with many challenges, however. We’re positioned to deliver our balance sheet and grow as prices normalize. While we have deferred many high return project opportunities to help prices rise, we’re also identifying additional investments that should create value throughout the commodity cycle as we continue to refine our life of field plans for our assets.

We have the operating flexibility to adjust our program rapidly based on market conditions and have the ability to shift basins and drive mechanisms to optimize returns while maintaining a predictable production profile.

We have a large inventory of conventional assets that have relatively low decline rates and long production lives and many of these conventional development projects are expected to be repeatable with low technical risk.

We are using this environment to improve our cost structure, implement efficiencies across all functions of the business, and improve the project economics of our portfolio of investment opportunities, so that we can rapidly take advantage of a more favorable commodity price environment in the future. We continue to be very excited about CRC's opportunities and are diligently working to make the improvements needed, including deleveraging to increase shareholder value.

This concludes our remarks and we now welcome your questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have comes from Doug Leggate, Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Doug Leggate

Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Mark I wonder, I don’t know if I misheard you on your debt trajectory or guidance. So if you can call it back through the end of the year, I wonder if I could just ask you to repeat that, but also embedded in there the deleveraging options, would you care to rank what -- how you would see the priorities of the list of the menu if you like of the different options that you have and specifically addressing whether you would be prepared to allow the operating costs to bump a little higher in order to monetize some midstream? And I’ve got a follow-up please.

Todd A. Stevens

Hey Doug, this is Todd. I think in my comments you will see that we talked about our quarter end debt balance is around $6.6 billion and we expect that essentially to be the same as it would be unless we had some other kind of deleveraging event occur at year-end. So effectively flat with this, now that we’ve had all the effects of our former parent work its way through the balance sheet. With regards to the deleveraging options, I think effectively if you think about the two buckets, midstream and upstream, midstream is effectively taking and putting some kind of fee or other structure on your income statement for the opportunity to delever the balance sheet side. So yes, there is that opportunity on that side. The other deleveraging options you look at on the upstream side are all kinds of asset monetization, but we're not particular married to any particular one. We are trying to find what's best for CRC and what has the optimal outcome from both a deleveraging standpoint and operational standpoint and tax consequences and other issues. So what I’d say now is we’ve identified most of those opportunities and now we are working through all the details in refining it to understand all the implications, particularly, on our operations going forward. And what's your follow-up, Doug?

Doug Leggate

Sorry Todd, just to be clear on that flat debt. What oil price assumption are you making? Does that assume any improvement? Because you talked about 75% of incremental free cash flow going to the balance sheet, so are you assuming that there is no recovery in the oil price in second-half, or what was your assumption there when you made that statement about the debt?

Todd A. Stevens

Yes, that’s the price lower than we are today and it's a price closer to $60 Brent as opposed to what we said today. And you’re right if we had a sustain to higher oil price, I think differentially we’d spend probably 75%-25%, 75% towards debt pay down and 25% investing in the business, if we were able to see that this higher price environment we’re in today is sustainable.

Doug Leggate

Okay. Thanks. My follow-up is really more about the capital efficiency of the portfolio. So you drilled 65 wells for $133 million. The majority of those were steamfloods. Can you give us some idea -- obviously there is a lag on the way these things behave, but what would you expect to be the aggregate peak of plateau production contribution from the average well in your -- that’s in your program right now and when would you anticipate to see that contribution kick in now? I will leave it there. Thanks.

Todd A. Stevens

Aggregate, I mean, we did have some waterflood wells in there too and steamflood wells. I think we could safety say if you aggregated it all, probably about 150 barrels a day equivalent, but we’re really talking about oil here.

Doug Leggate

Per well?

Todd A. Stevens

Yes, I think that’s a good average.

Doug Leggate

Across the 55 wells?

Todd A. Stevens

Yes.

Doug Leggate

All right. Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.

Todd A. Stevens

Pretty much flat, so yes.

Doug Leggate

Yes, that’s right. Yes, thanks very much.

Operator

Next we have Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research.

Paul Sankey

Good afternoon, everyone. Just stepping back to a higher level and then I have a specific one that follows up from that. But I guess are we looking at a strategy here that’s changed towards a maintenance capital strategy with the maximization of free cash flow as a priority which you have then explained would be a delevering strategy? And can you just run again through what you think your maintenance capital levels are, because there has been a tremendous amount of debate on one of the $450 million a year is really a number that can hold you flat on an ongoing basis if that was necessary? If we were to stay in a relatively lower price environment, which I guess seems to be around the 60 mark basis from what you’re saying, where would your maintenance capital be next year to stay flat is I guess what I’m driving at, right?

Todd A. Stevens

Yes, Paul, thanks. I think the issue really is we were delta balance sheet we had in an entirely different product price environment, and we got the credit amendment to buy us the time to square away our balance sheet and that’s what we’re undertaking at this point in time and putting our balance sheet and order. And as we told people, if you think about mid cycle economics we’d like to have a debt to EBITDA of around two times. So clearly we’re not in that environment today, but we don’t think this is a mid-cycle type price. So we’re trying to work our deleveraging options to get that squared away and you’re right, that is the contrary what we said. But we also did say we did look at our means and our cash flow and that’s what we’re doing effectively like this. We even have some debt pay down built into our current capital structure. So, the maintenance capital question on that question I think it’s not the $440 million or $450 million that you quoted, that you talked about. I think that’s going to hold -- for this year clearly its going to hold our oil modestly flat to up. If we continued in a very, this lower price environment for next year and a modest increase we think it would be -- oil would be essentially flat and BOEs would decline like we talked about. But I think our -- if you want to talk about maintenance capital from a BOE perspective, we haven’t really put that out there because we don’t really look at the gas investments in the same way using our VCI, so its really oil focus and that’s why you see its really focusing on maintaining our oil production as our top priority.

Paul Sankey

Yes, I understand that. So, basically what you’re saying is that you’re seeing with the modest increase from the $450 million you can maintain the oil volumes flat next year if necessary with the stress do you essentially of delevering down to the target that you outlined it two times.

Todd A. Stevens

Yes, I don’t think we’ll get there over night clearly in the two times. I don’t think there is one single magic ball that we’re looking at a lot of different options that we think will help us get there.

Paul Sankey

Understood. And then the price at which you would turn more optimistic if you want in terms of perhaps just reaps you in growth, can you give us a sense for where that price would be?

Todd A. Stevens

Well just sitting in today's current environment if we could see a sustainable $70 price, I think we might start about thinking about more activity and some debt pay down. But really from our standpoint it has to be sustainable as Mark likes to say it has to -- you have to be able to touch it and feel it and hug it and feel good about it. So, until we get to that environment I don’t think we’re going to make any dramatic changes. I think you would have to return back to, from a growth perspective I think we have that potential to grow off of our lower declining base. But I think you want to think about getting past the debt environment first before you really think about in deleveraging before we think about growing the business.

Paul Sankey

Understood. I look forward to the day that I cover oil and I can touch, feel and hug the oil prices that would be happy day for me too. So the specific question was that the CapEx you announced for the quarter I think was $133 million, but the press release has cash used in investing activities, it’s a minus $313 million, I hope that makes sense to you. Can you explain that difference for me?

Marshall D. Smith

Carry over from last year, Doug -- I’m sorry, Paul.

Paul Sankey

Okay. Is it kind of a headline CapEx at $133 million, but the press release has cash used in investing activities at $313 million that’s really more than double that?

Todd A. Stevens

Hey Paul, it’s Todd. I think that what Mark was trying to tell you is that, effectively when we were spun off in addition to the $6 billion in debt, and we had they -- at the spin off day they took our receivables and left us with a payable. So, you have some working capital working its way through the first quarter and so that’s effectively the difference. That’s what we saw now; all the effects of the payments to our prior parent have now worked their way effectively through the system now at the end of this quarter.

Paul Sankey

Right. You answered the question correct. Thank you.

Operator

Evan Calio, Morgan Stanley.

Evan Calio

Hi, good evening guys, long day. Let me follow-up on the deleveraging efforts. Any potential target for deleveraging from these transactions, I mean can you dimension range of amounts just up to $1 billion or any range and is it targeted timeline to close by year end?

Marshall D. Smith

Yes, hi Evan. Yes, I think the -- if you think about it looking at out debt we have about $5 billion of bonds. We have a $1 billion term loan that’s pre-payable, and we have our $600 million of working capital that’s on our facility. So, if you think about what's the easy things to pay down, clearly the facility and the term loan. And then you could -- the bonds, the first maturity that’s coming up is 2019. So, clearly you could buy some time there or try to be opportunistic, but there are no -- our bonds are no longer trading in the high 70s, low 80s, they’re trading in the mid 90s. So, I don’t think that’s an easy -- you could buy back and you get the effects of that at this point in time. But I think our short-term if you want to think about it our medium term target here is really to attack that $1.6 billion that we can, and we would hope to have one or two of these things closed by year end but for sure signed up and maybe we’re working through all the legal paperwork at this point in time.

Evan Calio

We’re achieving one or two transactions up to $1.6 million not the deleveraging the cash flow, is that -- did I understand that correctly?

Marshall D. Smith

Yes, I mean we could, it definitely would happen to the product prices. So I mean if something happen on the geopolitical level in the Middle East that dramatically drove up oil prices, clearly we would differentially expend the excess cash flow towards debt pay down in addition. So that would be in that $1.6 billion number. But at this point in time it might be, $1 million, it might be $2 million, it might be $3 million because we’re still working through and getting all the details and all these deleveraging options.

Evan Calio

Okay. So the consideration it sounds like it’s beyond just midstream assets into upstream assets if that’s the case, is that potentially that accurate?

Marshall D. Smith

Yes, I mean we’re pursuing all options and everything on the table. So, I think that if you saw something from the standpoint of something that made sense, clearly we don’t want to monetize upstream assets in the bottom of the cycle. But there are some creative structures where you can in effect get the kind of valuations you would like to get and do some kind of joint ventures or monetization that way. But we’re looking at lot of different ways and a lot of creative ways going forward.

Evan Calio

Great. And maybe a different question on the CapEx. I know that Paul handled the maintenance question. But I know you’ve lowered CapEx in the current environment, but do you have a different or lower CapEx yield or what it would cost to grow the company, the 6% to 9% which was your prior target. I know now you have some debt pay down, 75% debt paid down on some of that cash suite. I mean, is that still a $2 billion kind of number or is that also lower in this as you’ve kind of gone through and removed costs?

Marshall D. Smith

I think it’s definitely lower, but it’s not a way we’re really looking at things at this point in time given we’re staring at the screen, we’re staring at today. But yes, I think it’s definitely substantially lower than the number you quoted, but its not -- its not where we’re at today clearly.

Evan Calio

Yes, it was just more of a -- like a historic number?

Marshall D. Smith

No, it’s not anywhere close to that. That included a lot of things, including some infrastructure spending and some capital that we wouldn’t have spent and are under the way we are allocating our capital.

Evan Calio

And then just last one for me, to square the circle. So in terms of spending the $600 million for maintenance CapEx, and maybe I missed the number of the oil CapEx right, so whatever you’re saying is kind of maintenance oil CapEx, right? To offset a decline, what is the base decline that you’re offsetting with that amount?

Marshall D. Smith

Yes, if you think about it when we look at our reserve at yearend, with no downtime what so ever our base decline is about 10%. But if you factor in historical downtime it’s around 15%. I would say that we’ve had an exceptional first quarter with regard to downtime that we’ve ever seen here in California. So clearly we’re closer probably to the 10% than we are to the 15%, but luck will turn against you at some point in time as things, ESPs and rod pumps and everything else fail. But we’ve been doing an exceptional job on our base production, and hopefully that gives you the guide post that you need.

Evan Calio

Great. I appreciate that. Thank you

Marshall D. Smith

Thanks, Evan.

Operator

Next we have James Spicer, Wells Fargo.

James Spicer

Yes, hi everybody. A couple of my questions have been addressed. I just have one follow-up and that’s, on your fourth quarter call you talked about a $300 million contraction in working capital due to the drop in the rigs, and it looks like you have positive cash flow from operations about $115 million this quarter. Just wondering whether that $300 million is flowing through and the context is really, I think that last quarter if I remember correctly you said that you had $316 million drawn on your revolver and you expect it to end 2015 at that same level. So, I’m just trying to sort of triangulate this to what the cash flow trajectory is here for the remainder of the year?

Marshall D. Smith

Yes, I think if you look at it it’s in investment portion also, so it’s not all in the operation section. It’s just a classification, and there might be a little bit more to work its way through the fund flow statement as we get some weight, payables and receivables.

James Spicer

Okay. But if you’re going to end the year still with that $360 million of revolver draw that would imply that you’re going to be free cash flow positive for the remaining three quarters of the year?

Marshall D. Smith

I believe that’s right.

James Spicer

Okay. That answers my question. Thank you.

Next we have David Meats of Morningstar.

David Meats

Thanks guys. I just wanted to kind of revisit the maintenance issue a little bit, reframe that question. I was just wondering how long can you maintain the strategy of just focusing on the steam floods and the water floods to hold your oil production flat. I mean you mentioned probably 2016, but is that something that can carry on indefinitely?

Todd A. Stevens

I don’t know, you can't carry it on indefinitely, but I think for the foreseeable future we clearly have enormous amount of inventory to execute on that front as we said through ’16. I think as we get into ’17 I think it inches up from there, but its -- but we still have an off a lot steam floods and water floods. I think you might a cycle too where you need a little bit more facility if you got capital to get into 2017 also because that ebbs and flows with the patterns as you implement your pattern development in the steam floods and water floods.

David Meats

Okay. And you guys talked about JVs already. Is there anything that you would consider an outright sale of on the E&P side?

Todd A. Stevens

I think we would contemplate that, but it’s all a matter of valuation. If you want to give after valuation base note on the current strip, but a different strip and different economic measures and the traditional ones used by E&P players where it’s very strategic in nature. It’s something we contemplate again, like I said nothing is up the table. But there’s not a lot of people that value things from a strategic level, capturing the resource that way as opposed to using some kind of net present value measure of the current product price strip.

David Meats

Okay, fair enough. I think the rest of my questions have already been dealt with. So, I’m going to hop out here and let someone else in. Thank you.

Operator

Sean Sneeden of Oppenheimer.

Sean Sneeden

Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe Todd for you, as a follow-up on the PDP decline. I was wondering if you could kind of help us understand maybe the decline for oil and gas separately, I mean presumably, one, is going to be a little bit sharper than the other, but how should we be thinking about that going forward?

Todd A. Stevens

Yes, so I think it’s probably easier to think about it on a drive mechanism basis. So, if you thought about it and we can talk a little bit about oil too, but steam floods are 100% oil. Usually its kind of mid single digits type decline when it’s got past its plateau. Water floods -- a water flood is typically 5% to 10% decline if you have one that’s -- but if you’re in a place like Wilmington it could be higher than that, but that’s really mature. So if you think about it as most of our water floods are going to be in the 5% to 10% decline. Other opportunities if you thought about are unconventional, think about it in two different buckets. Our shales which we didn’t invest -- aren’t investing in this year usually have first year declines of 25%, 30%, and I think those are rolling off and flattening out as we get into this second and third year pass that. If you want to draw up share, we got natural gas declines in the Sacramento base where we haven’t drilled any wells there recently, but those have typically higher decline on new production there that might be more 25% type declines. But that’s just dry gas and that’s a very small part of what we get at this point in time, its contingent resources, gas prices ever got up into -- with a four handle. Hopefully that’s helpful, I mean its -- most of our oil is probably mid to slightly higher single digits.

Sean Sneeden

Okay. That’s helpful, and I might follow-up with you guys offline on that. I guess, the second question is just kind of more conceptual around a potential kind of upstream deal. I guess, just kind of curious how you think about it, but it sounds like the real preference is to delever, and just kind of considering where leverage is going this year. I’m kind of curious how you think about getting a upstream deal done that would be deleveraging versus more of a traditional kind of midstream deal which probably fits into that deleveraging ballpark?

Todd A. Stevens

Yes, you’re right. I mean the market for your yield vehicles offer midstream assets hasn’t -- there is plenty of liquidity there. I think in the upstream side it’s a little different. But I’d also tell you California is a little different. I mean, we have a unique set of assets out here particularly our exploration acreage, and for years under our prior parent, we didn’t solicit or really ever take partners, and there’s been a lot of people hovering around and if you understood the California oil and gas landscape you’d know you might be able to get a little lead from a farmer here and there, but pretty soon you’re going to bump up against CRC, and if you want to have any significant exposure to oil and gas resource here you have to partner with us. So, I think the people that have been hovering around for years or interested in the state and interested in wildcatting are now still interested and obviously realize this might be their one opportunity in this environment to get into to the opportunity set we have. And I would take it at some kind of cash and carry type deal, but you just never know how that would turn into it. But we have more than enough parties that are interested on the exploration and exploitation side of our asset base.

Sean Sneeden

Okay. Now that helpful. Thank you very much.

Next we have Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Pavel Molchanov

Hi, guys, its Pavel. A question on realized pricing, in the past there has been times when your realized pricing was above WTI. I think in the quarter it was averaged about $2 below WTI. As your production and presumably other producers in California kind of goes lower, do you think that premium is likely to emerge again?

Todd A. Stevens

You have to think about our production as being tied to Brent as opposed to WTI. We’re in effectively a closed market for crude oil production and marketing and distribution. So, we have -- are squared of over 80% to Brent. So, we guided down because when you have this closed system we had the discreet events that torrents and then nation wide refinery strike that brought down the differentials in the quarter, but when the refinery strike came back we can see them starting to get better in the state. But again I think your benchmark is better to tie into Brent than it is to WTI.

Pavel Molchanov

Okay. Maybe I’ll ask it a little differently. The spread versus Brent went from single basis last year to 15% this past quarter. Do you see that narrowing back down as in-state volumes decline over time?

Todd A. Stevens

Yes, I think so. I think because that’s what you’re competing against, but also if you have an institution of and you get rid of the export ban that clearly will bring it more into parity over time, and so effectively you’re going to have and be very close to each other and just that the WTI will represent maybe a pricing transportation from the Gulf Coast to Cushing.

Pavel Molchanov

Okay. And then, one more question on your hedge book. Given the extent of Contango in both Brent and WTI at the moment, are you layering any hedges for 2016 right now?

Todd A. Stevens

As you can see we didn’t -- we haven’t layered in any yet. We continue to look at the markets and be opportunistic. We’re towards the bottom of the cycle here, and so it’s not the perfect time to implement a hedging strategy, but you got to remember too how options are priced. Time and volatility are the most important things. So, the further you go out in time the more you’re going to pay for it. But we’re just trying to be opportunistic and look for a technical dislocation on days where we feel like we can lock in some hedges that makes sense for us and hope for the price environment continues where its at and inches a little bit further higher.

Pavel Molchanov

All right. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.

Next Brad Lundy, Ivory Capital.

Bradley Lundy

Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to clarify, were you referencing your oil production guidance as effectively flat Q2 versus Q1?

Todd A. Stevens

Yes, that’s what we said.

Bradley Lundy

Okay, perfect. So, if I step back and look at it, you’re actually growing oil production from Q4 exits right, Q1, Q2 through the year on $440 million of total CapEx. When that’s just kind of a maintenance CapEx profile the business is actually below $440 million on an oil only basis.

Todd A. Stevens

No, I think we have some, a little bit of headwinds coming into the year from some facilities spending and we’re front end loading the $133 million we spend in the first quarter that’s more facilities. So, I think that you’re going to see that, that’s still a little bit low from oil maintenance CapEx.

Bradley Lundy

Got you. And how should we think about the cadence of that oil production profile as you get through into the back half of the year?

Todd A. Stevens

Yes, I think you could probably extrapolate it and look at what we’ve said about, though year-over-year we should average very close to if not essentially the same as last year 159 BOE and I think if you extrapolate that linearly, you wouldn’t be dramatically off.

Bradley Lundy

Perfect. Thank you.

Gregg Brody, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Gregg Brody

Hey, guys just a couple of questions for you. You mentioned the two times leverage target based on, sort of a normalized oil price. Are you going to share with that, what you think that normalized oil price is?

Todd A. Stevens

I think though, what I will say is that we’re trying to gear up our organization from a G&A standpoint going forward to be right sized at $75 Brent.

Gregg Brody

And the one other question was, you mentioned your policy for hedging. I think you mentioned that 12 to 24 month policy. Could you just repeat what the policy is and sort of how hard and fast is that now?

Todd A. Stevens

Yes, 12 to 18 I think we’re clearly looking to implement that and as we get back to what we consider more mid cycle prices we’ll continue to layer in hedges and underpin our capital program and our cash flow.

Gregg Brody

And was there a percentage you were targeting for 12 to 18 months?

Todd A. Stevens

I think if we got in a normalized environment we’d want to hedge at least 50%.

Gregg Brody

Got it. That’s very helpful. Thank you guys.

Operator

Next Gary Stromberg, Barclays.

Gary Stromberg

Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on cost trends in first quarter of ’15 and then the rest of the year. I guess, I was surprised to see unit operating cost going up from $16.07 to $16.20, and then guidance I think was up another 5% in the second quarter. So, I just wanted to get a sense for trends on the operating cost line in the first and second quarter and the rest of the year, and the same thing with G&A. It looks like G&A is projected to be up second quarter versus first quarter.

Todd A. Stevens

No, I think if you look at on an absolute basis the operating cost were down, and its just -- if you think about, the number of days are shorter in the first quarter, so on a $16.07 to $16.20 its effectively almost flat. I think when you think about California the peak energy season, the peak rates start accruing really in the second and third quarter, so you’ll see that creep up. We’re hoping to claw back that as much as possible from an efficiencies, but again we’re guiding to what we think as we know today. But yes, the first and fourth quarter are typically the lowest price energy costs going forward. And I think if you look at the G&A you got to remember bonuses are paid in the first quarter.

Gary Stromberg

Okay. So the trend beyond the second quarter and operating costs, your second quarter guidance is $16.70 to $17.20. In a deflationary oil field service environment, would that move down from that level or is that a pretty good level going forward?

Todd A. Stevens

I think it is pretty good. That’s what we gave as guidance. I mean, obviously we strive to be under it.

Gary Stromberg

Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.

Next we have a follow-up from Doug Leggate, Bank of America.

Doug Leggate

Sorry guys. I tried to stick to the two question rule, so go back in queue. Just two quick follow-ups, if I may. It’s really the comment you made about a couple of transactions, turn of the year type of commentary. You said if not closed, then definitely signed. It sounds like you already have some line of sight. So I’m just wondering if you can kind of characterize what inning are you in, in terms of this negotiation. Are we just getting started out of the gate, or do you already have line of sight as to where we’re going to see some of the deleveraging? And I do have a follow-up please.

Todd A. Stevens

I think we’ve cast our net as wide as possible. We're now looking through our suite of options and kind of going through the details and trying to refine things from tax perspective, operational considerations, and ultimately proceeds. So I think at this point of time we are working through the details to understand all the different opportunities we are looking at. I think it's early on, but we are not far away from once we have that refined or we could start looking to execute with more and more parties. Some of these are more complex than others and require more tax attorneys and regular attorneys and others. But that’s why I think that we will have something signed up at least or it’s not close by year-end.

Doug Leggate

To be clear, are you in height of discussions today?

Todd A. Stevens

We are discussing a variety of different opportunities with different folks. I don’t think you could call it active negotiation, but we’re clearly discussing a lot of different opportunities as we cast a wide net to everyone and looking at that at this point in time.

Doug Leggate

Okay. My follow-up is on -- almost a reverse hedging question. Gas is obviously very depressed, it’s a big part of your cost basis. Any consideration of hedging to lock in low gas prices as opposed to high oil prices, so to speak?

Todd A. Stevens

Yes Doug, I think you have been looking at the California basis. California it had a very mild winter. 90% of natural gas is imported typically at trades at $0.10 to $0.15 premium to NYMEX. That collapse quite a bit and so, yes, I think there is an opportunity if this mild weather continues in storage in California relatively full to potentially lock in some lower natural gas prices as a feedstock for our steamfloods.

Doug Leggate

That’s great. Thanks a lot.

Operator

And our last question will come from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.

Evan Calio

Hi, guys. Just one quick follow-up from me, if you have it. I just -- I didn't know if there is any quantification of cash flow related to the cryo plant or the power plant on a standalone basis. Have you got any ways to think about that?

Todd A. Stevens

Yes, I think there isn’t, because it’s integrated currently as operations. So if you think about it from the standpoint of -- and the way we like to talk to people is we’ve around 50 million barrels of equivalent production. And if you thought about it from the standpoint of layering on a $1 fee or operating cost charge, how we want to call it or structure it, that $50 million a year you could put in of EBITDA and create, or $2 obviously $100 million. So that’s kind of I think the boundary conditions what we look at when we think about. What we could layer on to our operations and sustain that. So I think hopefully that gives you some idea along those lines.

Evan Calio

That’s great. And when you gave the kind of number of potential, it could be up to $1.6 billion, is that -- that’s pre-tax, after tax?

Todd A. Stevens

That will be what we take account, because obviously we want to pay down the $1.6 billion and that’s after tax dollars. We hope to get there through a variety of ways.
