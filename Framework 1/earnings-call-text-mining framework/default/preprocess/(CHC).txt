Everything we’re doing at CHC is guided by three things; first, our fundamental commitment to safety; second, to satisfy our customers; and third, our financial priorities, which include strengthening our balance sheet, expanding EBITDAR dollars and margin, and growing with discipline.

As always on these calls, I will start by talking about safety, specifically our rolling five-year accident rate. Through the end of fiscal Q1, CHC’s performance against its primary industry major held steady for the previous quarter at 0.38 accidents per 100,000 flight hours. This rate includes an accident last year off the coast of Sumburgh in the U.K. On August 23, the one-year anniversary of that incident, CHC people around the world paused. We honored the memories of the four passengers who perished on that tragic day.

Please turn to page 5. As you review our first quarter segment results, please be aware that they reflect an internal realignment and the associated change in how we record inter-company revenue and costs. This is for Heli-One or MRO services, which perform aircraft that are flown by our Helicopter Services division.

The change doesn’t affect consolidated CHC results, but it does alter segment results for Helicopter Services and Heli-One. It will increase visibility, accountability, decision-making across both these units. Joan will go into more details regarding this change.

We delivered results in line with our expectations for the first quarter and further progressed towards our long-term objective of superior financial performance and value creation.

Revenues were up solidly and adjusted EBITDAR also increased. There are several reasons, internal and external, for our continued optimism about the helicopter services industry and CHC’s unique place within it. They can be summarized by four highlights.

They are; first, a significant long-term growth opportunity supported by strong market fundamentals. Nigeria, we have established a thoughtful and capable presence, provides a particularly vivid example. Industry tenders for flying services are anticipated over the next 18 months that could in fact eclipse over three dozen aircraft.

Second, highlight is our market leadership position and proud safety record. The motivation of CHC people is not simply to enhance safety in our own operations but also to help spearhead higher levels of safety for everybody in our industry.

Third, we are increasingly encouraged by our operational excellence, and this has been created through our transformation and our commitment to continuous improvement.

Let me give you a real-life example. Our aircraft availability has been steadily rising over the past several months, and by every indication, represents best-in-class performance by our team. Better supply chain management along with improved maintenance planning are among the reasons for our improvement, and they are made possible in part by collapsing multiple different tool systems and processes into one leading-edge system used by our teams across the world.

And fourth, as you also heard about our financial priorities, we are determined to achieve disciplined profitable growth across our flying and MRO businesses through contracts that are consistently good for our customers and good for CHC, and our global revenue stream is very resilient. More than 70% of our flying revenue is tied to oil and gas production, and the majority of our economics are covered by monthly standing charges.

Now Joan will walk you through the details of our fiscal first quarter results, after which we’ll have an ample time to answer any of your questions. Joan?

Joan Hooper

Thank you, Bill. Please turn to page 6. First quarter results were in line with our expectations and we are pleased with our progress toward meeting the full-year targets that we communicated in August.

Consolidated revenue was $461 million, up 11%, driven by growth from new contracts in both Helicopter Services and Heli-One.

As expected, EBITDAR was up 1% to $112 million, aided by improved margins from new contracts in both segments. Growth in EBITDAR was moderated by approximately $4 million of stock compensation expense, expenses we did not have last year when we were private. This was worth about 3 points of growth in the quarter and also negatively impacted the margin percentage.

Now, I want to point out that over the last few years our consolidated EBITDAR has been back-end loaded with more than 50% of our annual EBITDAR realized in the second half of our fiscal year and we expect fiscal ’15 to follow that trend.

Please turn to page 7, before I discuss our segment results, let me elaborate on the change in segment reporting that Bill mentioned. This change was driven by an internal realignment to ensure an even higher level of accountability for maintenance decisions and it’s the logical next step in our transformation initiatives.

The realignment was aided by our implementation of new IT tools, such as AMOS, that enhance our supply chain processes. Previously, Helicopter Services procured maintenance services from Heli-One through a power-by-the-hour, or PBH, structure. Heli-One’s internal revenue was recognized on a fixed rate per Helicopter Services flight hour, including a pass-through of costs for outsourced maintenance not provided directly by Heli-One. This mechanism resulted in Heli-One’s revenue and costs not always being aligned from quarter-to-quarter, resulting in increased volatility in their results.

We have now moved from an internal PBH model to an MRO model where Heli-One will charge Helicopter Services for work performed by Heli-One on a time and materials basis. Helicopter Services will contract directly with third-party providers for work that Heli-One does not have the capabilities to perform.

In the new structure, variation related to the timing of maintenance events will impact Helicopter Services segment whereas in the past it impacted Heli-One. Since the activities and decisions within our Helicopter Services segment have more direct impact than maintenance events, this change will better align their decisions and financial results.

Helicopter Services costs will now be matched more closely to the maintenance requirement generating from its operation. This will also remove some volatility from Heli-One and make their results more predictable. As Bill mentioned, there is no impact on our consolidated results, only at the segment level.

We have included restated quarterly results for fiscal 2014 and restated annual results for fiscal 2013 in both our earnings release and our web deck. All references to Helicopter Services and Heli-One’s performance, including growth rates and margin, now reflect the new structure.

Please turn to page 8, revenue for Helicopter Services was up 9%, driven by new contracts, notably in Western North Sea and increased flight hours in Brazil. EBITDAR was up 1%, driven by the increase in SAR activity in Western North Sea and new contracts with improved margins across our regions. As expected, this improvement was partially offset by some contract completions.

While our HE count declined by 3% year-over-year, our HE rate jumped 15%. This growth was driven by the return to service of our EC225 aircraft and our continued strategy to increase our mix of newer technology aircraft.

Please turn to page 9, moving on to Heli-One. Third-party revenue increased 34%, driven by additional MRO work and an increase in external PBH revenue from both new and existing contracts. The increase in margin from new contracts in both the external PBH and MRO business contributed to a 26% increase in EBITDAR for Heli-One.

Please turn to page 10, as we’ve discussed in the past, we are very focused on every opportunity to improve free cash flow and strengthen our balance sheet, and we are starting to realize these benefits.

Operating cash flow was a use of $31 million, an improvement of $13 million versus last year, driven by lower interest expense and improvements in working capital. The decline in interest expense was due to our repurchase of our senior secured notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and in May of this calendar year.

In addition to lowering our fixed costs, another lever we have to drive improvement in cash flow is working capital. In the quarter, we made additional progress in lowering our days sales outstanding, driving a decline of two days versus last year, and each day is worth approximately $4.5 million in cash to us.

I’ll now open the line up for questions, operator.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Hilda Maraachlian with Cormark Securities. Please proceed with your question.

Hilda Maraachlian - Cormark Securities

Bill, you gave some comments in your prepared remarks, but can you just give a bit more color on Nigeria, what are you seeing out there and has anything changed since you gave an update, I know you guys were talking about some issues there, regulatory issues, just give us an update on what’s going on there?

Bill Amelio

Sure. As I pointed out, there is at least three dozen opportunities that are in front of us in the pipeline over the next 18 months, and we’re tracking them from the standpoint of when the opportunity hits our pipeline to where we give technical requirements to customers to where we give commercial terms to customers and finally win the bid.

And on a couple of the major ones, we at least moved through the technical phase and in one, in fact, commercial phase. So we’re pretty enthusiastic with respect to the progress that’s happened since the last time we had a call, but then again at any time things can change in Nigeria with respect to the regulators. So we’ll keep an eye closely on this, but at this juncture, it’s positive news.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praveen Narra with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.

Praveen Narra - Raymond James

Could you guys comment on what you are seeing from a leading-edge market pricing standpoint, and if you could, any reasons that are standouts from the trend?

Bill Amelio

I think the best way to describe it would be stability. If you’ve been following the oil and gas service sectors, which I think you had, you will know that lot of the oil companies are, in fact, thinking about cost, cost, cost and we’re seeing some of that with respect to - they’re asking us to be creative with respect to how we do tenders and be able to figure out cost savings for them. So I would characterize again as stable with respect to pricing.

Praveen Narra - Raymond James

And then, in terms of getting the centralized efficiencies, centralized system efficiencies gained, where are we in terms of the run rate or we kind of running full run rate or is there some more fruit to be picked?

Bill Amelio

There’s some more fruit to be picked. We’re -- I would say characterize all the systems together, we’re probably 75% of the way through, different phases between regions but that’s roughly right for the entire company, so we still got 25% to go with respect to getting fully implemented and after it’s fully implemented, of course, there will still be some more time before we get full run rate savings in place.

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Henry Voskoboynik with Fore Advisors. Please proceed with your question.

Henry Voskoboynik - Fore Advisors

Two questions, mostly regarding to the investment by Clayton and Dubilier. Can you walk us through the timeline and also the requirements for this deal to happen in terms of the shareholder vote, [the time] [ph], just the timeline? Thanks.

Joan Hooper

I can talk real high level. As Lynn indicated in her opening remarks, we really can’t speak with a lot of specificity on the transaction until we go through the filings, but as we indicated on the August call, we expect or hope to close the transaction by the end of this calendar year. Process wise, we need to file both the proxy and an S1 in order to do that and then obviously that goes through the SEC review process, which is why we’re unable to give a definitive timeline.

Henry Voskoboynik - Fore Advisors

And a follow-up to that, it looks like again some of the terms, if I understand correctly, that’s $500 million and then $100 million rights [that’s been backed up] [ph] by CDR as well. If they take down the whole $600 million at a conversion price of $7.50, it looks like they will own 80 million shares on an as-converted basis, which is about 50% of the total outstanding shares pro forma, and the three years of the coupons are picked at 8.5%, that takes them over the 50% threshold, what am I missing?

Joan Hooper

Well, again, I can’t comment specifically. I will remind you, however, that we did have a web deck on our August 22 earnings call to discuss the transaction. I can’t discuss any more details on that. When the proxy is filed, those details will be in the proxy.

Lynn Tyson

Also, we just filed an 8-K. I think it was about two days after we made the announcement that has all of the agreements, and if you haven’t had a chance to read the agreement, I encourage you to do that, because most of the questions that you asked would be answered in those agreements.

Henry Voskoboynik - Fore Advisors

And when do you expect to file the proxy?

Joan Hooper

Soon. I don’t have a specific date, but it should be soon.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Sneeden with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.

Sean Sneeden - Oppenheimer

Most of the questions were answered, but maybe Joan for you, I definitely appreciate your commentary on deleveraging the capital structure and it looks like you guys are taking pretty good steps there, but can you perhaps help me out in thinking about specific kind of longer-term leverage targets that you guys are hoping to achieve?

Joan Hooper

Well, again, I’m not in a position to do that because of the quiet period that Lynn mentioned in her opening comments. So we’re unable, at this point, to update guidance, but again if you go back and look at some of the comments we did make on the August 22 call we talked about, the expectation for how much that proposed transaction would help us from a cash flow standpoint, so unfortunately I’m not in a position to give you any more specifics than that at this point.

Sean Sneeden - Oppenheimer

And then, maybe just so I understand you obviously really highlighted, it seems like you paid down some of the bonds, [indiscernible] unsecured bonds?

Joan Hooper

Sorry, I didn’t --. You’re cutting out, and I didn’t quite get your question.

Sean Sneeden - Oppenheimer

Is it fair to assume that the payback of at least the [indiscernible] of the unsecured bond through the equity claw provision or [you going out] [ph] and actually going to tender for them?

Joan Hooper

Again, I can’t comment today any differently than what has been done in the past, but if you go look at the prepared remarks and the web deck associated with our August 22 call, I think you’ll find some of that information.

Operator

Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Michael Henderson-Cohen with Andalusian. Please proceed with your question.

Michael Henderson-Cohen - Andalusian

Just a quick question or two on the EBITDAR margins that you are seeing in your Helicopter Services division and Heli-One division. On Helicopter Services, on page 8, just comparing Q1 of ‘15 versus Q1 of ’14, looks like there is some compression there, and yet there is higher margins with these new contracts, and I would imagine that some of the contracts that are coming off are largely lower margin. I just was wondering if you could kind of bridge the gap there or just touch a little bit more on what’s going on?

Joan Hooper

Typically, and this relates to the comment I made about how the EBITDAR is back-end loaded. Typically, we invest in a lot of our supply chain in the beginning of the year, and so that happened again this quarter, and again with the change in alignment, those costs are now sitting in the Helicopter Services P&L. So that would be a piece of it.

Michael Henderson-Cohen - Andalusian

And that not happen, I guess, in Q1 of last year?

Joan Hooper

Well, it’s been more investment, and is linked directly to what Bill talked about. We made a concerted effort to improve our availability and we’re able to do that through investing in our supply chain. So if you think about all the enhancements we’ve made through the systems and processes, we’ve invested in ensuring that the right parts are in the right place around the world and that creates some hit initially on the P&L, but we are very happy with the results on availability. So it is more investment than we would have done in the past.

Operator

Thank You. Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve come to the end of our time for questions. I’d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Amelio for closing remarks.

Bill Amelio

Thank you. Let’s turn to page 11. We always value the time that we spend with you so you have a better chance to understand CHC along with the feedback you can provide us through this call as well as through other forums.

Rest assured that we’ll continue to strategically and actively manage CHC. It’s all about us being able to provide safe, predictable, high-quality services to our customers and fulfilling our financial priorities, and recall those financial priorities are, for us, to strengthen our balance sheet, expand EBITDAR dollars and margins and to drive disciplined growth.
